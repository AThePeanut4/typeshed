"""
The Armenian calendar begins on 11 July 552 (Julian) and has two modes of
reckoning. The first is the invariant-length version consisting of 12 months
of 30 days each and five epagomenal days; the second is the version
established by Yovhannes Sarkawag in 1084, which fixed the first day of the
year with respect to the Julian calendar and added a sixth epagomenal day
every four years.

By default the invariant calendar is used, but the Sarkawag calendar can be
used beginning with the Armenian year 533 (11 August 1084) by passing the
parameter ``method='sarkawag'`` to the relevant functions.
