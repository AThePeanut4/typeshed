"""
The Convertdate library contains methods and functions for converting dates between
different calendar systems.

It was originally developed as as `Python Date Util <(http://sourceforge.net/projects/pythondateutil/>`__
by Phil Schwartz. It has been significantly updated and expanded.

Most of the original code is ported from
`Fourmilab's calendar converter <http://www.fourmilab.ch/documents/calendar/>`__,
which was developed by John Walker.

The algorithms are believed to be derived from: Meeus, Jean. `Astronomical Algorithms`,
Richmond: Willmann-Bell, 1991 (ISBN 0-943396-35-2)
