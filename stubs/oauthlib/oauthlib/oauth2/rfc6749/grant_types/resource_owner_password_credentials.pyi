    `Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant`_

    The resource owner password credentials grant type is suitable in
    cases where the resource owner has a trust relationship with the
    client, such as the device operating system or a highly privileged
    application.  The authorization server should take special care when
    enabling this grant type and only allow it when other flows are not
    viable.

    This grant type is suitable for clients capable of obtaining the
    resource owner's credentials (username and password, typically using
    an interactive form).  It is also used to migrate existing clients
    using direct authentication schemes such as HTTP Basic or Digest
    authentication to OAuth by converting the stored credentials to an
    access token::

    Figure 5: Resource Owner Password Credentials Flow

    The flow illustrated in Figure 5 includes the following steps:

    (A)  The resource owner provides the client with its username and
            password.

    (B)  The client requests an access token from the authorization
            server's token endpoint by including the credentials received
            from the resource owner.  When making the request, the client
            authenticates with the authorization server.

    (C)  The authorization server authenticates the client and validates
            the resource owner credentials, and if valid, issues an access
            token.

        If the access token request is valid and authorized, the
        authorization server issues an access token and optional refresh
        token as described in `Section 5.1`_.  If the request failed client
        authentication or is invalid, the authorization server returns an
        error response as described in `Section 5.2`_.

        The client makes a request to the token endpoint by adding the
        following parameters using the "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
        format per Appendix B with a character encoding of UTF-8 in the HTTP
        request entity-body:

        grant_type
                REQUIRED.  Value MUST be set to "password".

        username
                REQUIRED.  The resource owner username.

        password
                REQUIRED.  The resource owner password.

        scope
                OPTIONAL.  The scope of the access request as described by
                `Section 3.3`_.

        If the client type is confidential or the client was issued client
        credentials (or assigned other authentication requirements), the
        client MUST authenticate with the authorization server as described
        in `Section 3.2.1`_.

        The authorization server MUST:

        o  require client authentication for confidential clients or for any
            client that was issued client credentials (or with other
            authentication requirements),

        o  authenticate the client if client authentication is included, and

        o  validate the resource owner password credentials using its
            existing password validation algorithm.

        Since this access token request utilizes the resource owner's
        password, the authorization server MUST protect the endpoint against
        brute force attacks (e.g., using rate-limitation or generating
        alerts).
