        :param str named_pipe:  if set, a named pipe is used to connect (Windows only)
        :param str init_command:
            command which is run once the connection is created

        :param str read_default_file:
            file from which default client values are read

        :param str read_default_group:
            configuration group to use from the default file

        :param type cursorclass:
            class object, used to create cursors (keyword only)

        :param bool use_unicode:
            If True, text-like columns are returned as unicode objects
            using the connection's character set. Otherwise, text-like
            columns are returned as bytes. Unicode objects will always
            be encoded to the connection's character set regardless of
            this setting.
            Default to True.

        :param str charset:
            If supplied, the connection character set will be changed
            to this character set.

        :param str collation:
            If ``charset`` and ``collation`` are both supplied, the
            character set and collation for the current connection
            will be set.

            If omitted, empty string, or None, the default collation
            for the ``charset`` is implied.

        :param str auth_plugin:
            If supplied, the connection default authentication plugin will be
            changed to this value. Example values:
            `mysql_native_password` or `caching_sha2_password`

            If supplied, the session SQL mode will be changed to this
            setting.
            For more details and legal values, see the MySQL documentation.

            flags to use or 0 (see MySQL docs or constants/CLIENTS.py)

            If True, enable multi statements for clients >= 4.1.
            Defaults to True.

            specify the security settings for connection to the server;
            see the MySQL documentation for more details
            (mysql_option(), MYSQL_OPT_SSL_MODE).
            Only one of 'DISABLED', 'PREFERRED', 'REQUIRED',
            'VERIFY_CA', 'VERIFY_IDENTITY' can be specified.

        :param dict ssl:
            dictionary or mapping contains SSL connection parameters;
            see the MySQL documentation for more details
            (mysql_ssl_set()).  If this is set, and the client does not
            support SSL, NotSupportedError will be raised.
            Since mysqlclient 2.2.4, ssl=True is alias of ssl_mode=REQUIRED
            for better compatibility with PyMySQL and MariaDB.

        :param str server_public_key_path:
            specify the path to a file RSA public key file for caching_sha2_password.
            See https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/9.0/en/caching-sha2-pluggable-authentication.html

            enables LOAD LOCAL INFILE; zero disables

            If True, autocommit is enabled.

            If set, the '_binary' prefix will be used for raw byte query
            arguments (e.g. Binary). This is disabled by default.
