"""
an adaptation of the MySQL C API (mostly)

You probably are better off using MySQLdb instead of using this
module directly.

In general, renaming goes from mysql_* to _mysql.*. _mysql.connect()
returns a connection object (MYSQL). Functions which expect MYSQL * as
an argument are now methods of the connection object. A number of things
return result objects (MYSQL_RES). Functions which expect MYSQL_RES * as
an argument are now methods of the result object. Deprecated functions
(as of 3.23) are NOT implemented.

    string_literal(obj) -- converts object obj into a SQL string literal.
    This means, any special SQL characters are escaped, and it is enclosed
    within single quotes. In other words, it performs:

    "'%s'" % escape_string(str(obj))

    Use connection.string_literal(obj), if you use it at all.
    _mysql.string_literal(obj) cannot handle character sets.
