    """
    helper class for implementing hash handlers.

    GenericHandler-derived classes will have (at least) the following
    constructor options, though others may be added by mixins
    and by the class itself:

    :param checksum:
        this should contain the digest portion of a
        parsed hash (mainly provided when the constructor is called
        by :meth:`from_string()`).
        defaults to ``None``.

    :param use_defaults:
        If ``False`` (the default), a :exc:`TypeError` should be thrown
        if any settings required by the handler were not explicitly provided.

        If ``True``, the handler should attempt to provide a default for any
        missing values. This means generate missing salts, fill in default
        cost parameters, etc.

        This is typically only set to ``True`` when the constructor
        is called by :meth:`hash`, allowing user-provided values
        to be handled in a more permissive manner.

    :param relaxed:
        If ``False`` (the default), a :exc:`ValueError` should be thrown
        if any settings are out of bounds or otherwise invalid.

        If ``True``, they should be corrected if possible, and a warning
        issue. If not possible, only then should an error be raised.
        (e.g. under ``relaxed=True``, rounds values will be clamped
        to min/max rounds).

        This is mainly used when parsing the config strings of certain
        hashes, whose specifications implementations to be tolerant
        of incorrect values in salt strings.

    Class Attributes
    ================

    .. attribute:: ident

        [optional]
        If this attribute is filled in, the default :meth:`identify` method will use
        it as a identifying prefix that can be used to recognize instances of this handler's
        hash. Filling this out is recommended for speed.

        This should be a unicode str.

    .. attribute:: _hash_regex

        [optional]
        If this attribute is filled in, the default :meth:`identify` method
        will use it to recognize instances of the hash. If :attr:`ident`
        is specified, this will be ignored.

        This should be a unique regex object.

    .. attribute:: checksum_size

        [optional]
        Specifies the number of characters that should be expected in the checksum string.
        If omitted, no check will be performed.

    .. attribute:: checksum_chars

        [optional]
        A string listing all the characters allowed in the checksum string.
        If omitted, no check will be performed.

        This should be a unicode str.

    .. attribute:: _stub_checksum

        Placeholder checksum that will be used by genconfig()
        in lieu of actually generating a hash for the empty string.
        This should be a string of the same datatype as :attr:`checksum`.

    ----------------------------
    Subclasses should set the :attr:`!backends` attribute to a tuple of the backends

        One copy of this method should be defined for each :samp:`name` within :attr:`!backends`.

        issuing warnings, etc.

        finish documenting this class's usage

    For hashes which need to select from multiple backends,
    depending on the host environment, this class
    offers a way to specify alternate :meth:`_calc_checksum` methods,
    and will dynamically chose the best one at runtime.

    .. versionchanged:: 1.7

        This class now derives from :class:`BackendMixin`, which abstracts
        out a more generic framework for supporting multiple backends.
        The public api (:meth:`!get_backend`, :meth:`!has_backend`, :meth:`!set_backend`)
        is roughly the same.

    Private API (Subclass Hooks)
    ----------------------------
    As of version 1.7, classes should implement :meth:`!_load_backend_{name}`, per
    :class:`BackendMixin`.  This hook should invoke :meth:`!_set_calc_checksum_backcend`
    to install it's backend method.

    .. deprecated:: 1.7

        The following api is deprecated, and will be removed in Passlib 2.0:

    .. attribute:: _has_backend_{name}

        private class attribute checked by :meth:`has_backend` to see if a
        specific backend is available, it should be either ``True``
        or ``False``. One of these should be provided by
        the subclass for each backend listed in :attr:`backends`.

    .. classmethod:: _calc_checksum_{name}

        private class method that should implement :meth:`_calc_checksum`
        for a given backend. it will only be called if the backend has
        been selected by :meth:`set_backend`. One of these should be provided
        by the subclass for each backend listed in :attr:`backends`.
