class PasswordValueError(ValueError):
    """
    Error raised if a password can't be hashed / verified for various reasons.
    This exception derives from the builtin :exc:`!ValueError`.

    May be thrown directly when password violates internal invariants of hasher
    (e.g. some don't support NULL characters).  Hashers may also throw more specific subclasses,
    such as :exc:`!PasswordSizeError`.

class PasswordSizeError(PasswordValueError):
    """
    Error raised if a password exceeds the maximum size allowed
    by Passlib (by default, 4096 characters); or if password exceeds
    a hash-specific size limitation.

    This exception derives from :exc:`PasswordValueError` (above).

    Many password hash algorithms take proportionately larger amounts of time and/or
    memory depending on the size of the password provided. This could present
    a potential denial of service (DOS) situation if a maliciously large
    password is provided to an application. Because of this, Passlib enforces
    a maximum size limit, but one which should be *much* larger
    than any legitimate password. :exc:`PasswordSizeError` derives
    from :exc:`!ValueError`.

    .. note::
        Applications wishing to use a different limit should set the
        ``PASSLIB_MAX_PASSWORD_SIZE`` environmental variable before
        Passlib is loaded. The value can be any large positive integer.

    As of version 1.7.3, this may also be raised if hash algorithm is known,
    but has been disabled due to FIPS mode (message will include phrase "disabled for fips").
