    .. deprecated:: 1.6
        This class has been deprecated, and will be removed in Passlib 1.8.
        All of its functionality has been rolled into :class:`CryptContext`.

    This class previously stored the configuration options for the
    CryptContext class. In the interest of interface simplification,
    all of this class' functionality has been rolled into the CryptContext
    class itself.
    The documentation for this class is now focused on  documenting how to
    migrate to the new api. Additionally, where possible, the deprecation
    warnings issued by the CryptPolicy methods will list the replacement call
    that should be used.

    Constructors
    ============
    CryptPolicy objects can be constructed directly using any of
    the keywords accepted by :class:`CryptContext`. Direct uses of the
    :class:`!CryptPolicy` constructor should either pass the keywords
    directly into the CryptContext constructor, or to :meth:`CryptContext.update`
    if the policy object was being used to update an existing context object.

    In addition to passing in keywords directly,
    CryptPolicy objects can be constructed by the following methods:

    .. automethod:: from_path
    .. automethod:: from_string
    .. automethod:: from_source
    .. automethod:: from_sources
    .. automethod:: replace

    Introspection

    All of the informational methods provided by this class have been deprecated
    by identical or similar methods in the :class:`CryptContext` class:

    .. automethod:: schemes
    .. automethod:: iter_handlers
    .. automethod:: get_handler
    .. automethod:: get_options
    .. automethod:: handler_is_deprecated
    .. automethod:: get_min_verify_time

    Exporting

    .. automethod:: to_file
    .. automethod:: to_string
