"""
Simple base-classes for extensions and filters.

None of the filter and extension functions are considered 'optional' by the
framework.  These base-classes provide simple implementations for the
Initialize and Terminate functions, allowing you to omit them,

It is not necessary to use these base-classes - but if you don't, you
must ensure each of the required methods are implemented.
