Policies

Note that Dispatchers are now implemented in "dispatcher.py", but
are still documented here.

Policies

 A policy is an object which manages the interaction between a public
 Python object, and COM .  In simple terms, the policy object is the
 object which is actually called by COM, and it invokes the requested
 method, fetches/sets the requested property, etc.  See the
 @win32com.server.policy.CreateInstance@ method for a description of
 how a policy is specified or created.

 Exactly how a policy determines which underlying object method/property
 is obtained is up to the policy.  A few policies are provided, but you
 can build your own.  See each policy class for a description of how it
 implements its policy.

 There is a policy that allows the object to specify exactly which
 methods and properties will be exposed.  There is also a policy that
 will dynamically expose all Python methods and properties - even those
 added after the object has been instantiated.

Dispatchers

 A Dispatcher is a level in front of a Policy.  A dispatcher is the
 thing which actually receives the COM calls, and passes them to the
 policy object (which in turn somehow does something with the wrapped
 object).

 It is important to note that a policy does not need to have a dispatcher.
 A dispatcher has the same interface as a policy, and simply steps in its
 place, delegating to the real policy.  The primary use for a Dispatcher
 is to support debugging when necessary, but without imposing overheads
 when not (ie, by not using a dispatcher at all).

 There are a few dispatchers provided - "tracing" dispatchers which simply
 prints calls and args (including a variation which uses
 win32api.OutputDebugString), and a "debugger" dispatcher, which can
 invoke the debugger when necessary.

Error Handling

 It is important to realise that the caller of these interfaces may
 not be Python.  Therefore, general Python exceptions and tracebacks aren't
 much use.

 In general, there is an COMException class that should be raised, to allow
 the framework to extract rich COM type error information.

 The general rule is that the **only** exception returned from Python COM
 Server code should be an COMException instance.  Any other Python exception
 should be considered an implementation bug in the server (if not, it
 should be handled, and an appropriate COMException instance raised).  Any
 other exception is considered "unexpected", and a dispatcher may take
 special action (see Dispatchers above)

 Occasionally, the implementation will raise the policy.error error.
 This usually means there is a problem in the implementation that the
 Python programmer should fix.

 For example, if policy is asked to wrap an object which it can not
 support (because, eg, it does not provide _public_methods_ or _dynamic_)
 then policy.error will be raised, indicating it is a Python programmers
 problem, rather than a COM error.

    The base class of policies.

    Normally not used directly (use a child class, instead)

    This policy assumes we are wrapping another object
    as the COM server.  This supports the delegation of the core COM entry points
    to either the wrapped object, or to a child class.

    This policy supports the following special attributes on the wrapped object

    _query_interface_ -- A handler which can respond to the COM 'QueryInterface' call.
    _com_interfaces_ -- An optional list of IIDs which the interface will assume are
        valid for the object.
    _invoke_ -- A handler which can respond to the COM 'Invoke' call.  If this attribute
        is not provided, then the default policy implementation is used.  If this attribute
        does exist, it is responsible for providing all required functionality - ie, the
        policy _invoke_ method is not invoked at all (and nor are you able to call it!)
    _getidsofnames_ -- A handler which can respond to the COM 'GetIDsOfNames' call.  If this attribute
        is not provided, then the default policy implementation is used.  If this attribute
        does exist, it is responsible for providing all required functionality - ie, the
        policy _getidsofnames_ method is not invoked at all (and nor are you able to call it!)

    IDispatchEx functionality:

    _invokeex_ -- Very similar to _invoke_, except slightly different arguments are used.
        And the result is just the _real_ result (rather than the (hresult, argErr, realResult)
        tuple that _invoke_ uses.
        This is the new, prefered handler (the default _invoke_ handler simply called _invokeex_)
    _getdispid_ -- Very similar to _getidsofnames_, except slightly different arguments are used,
        and only 1 property at a time can be fetched (which is all we support in getidsofnames anyway!)
        This is the new, prefered handler (the default _invoke_ handler simply called _invokeex_)
    _getnextdispid_- uses self._name_to_dispid_ to enumerate the DISPIDs

                  attributes will be readable, but not writable, by other COM hosts.
     _value_ -- A method that will be called if the COM host requests the "default" method
                  (ie, calls Invoke with dispid==DISPID_VALUE)
     _NewEnum -- A method that will be called if the COM host requests an enumerator on the

    _typelib_guid_ -- The GUID of the typelibrary with interface definitions we use.
    _typelib_version_ -- A tuple of (major, minor) with a default of 1,1
    _typelib_lcid_ -- The LCID of the typelib, default = LOCALE_USER_DEFAULT
