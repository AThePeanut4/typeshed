    Add a source of messages to the event log.

    Allows Python program to register a custom source of messages in the
    registry.  You must also provide the DLL name that has the message table, so the
    full message text appears in the event log.

    Note that the win32evtlog.pyd file has a number of string entries with just "%1"
    built in, so many Python programs can simply use this DLL.  Disadvantages are that
    you do not get language translation, and the full text is stored in the event log,
    blowing the size of the log up.
