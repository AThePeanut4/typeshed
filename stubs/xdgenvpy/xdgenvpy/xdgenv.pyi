"""
Various specifications specify files and file formats. This specification
defines where these files should be looked for by defining one or more base
directories relative to which files should be located.

The XDG Base Directory Specification is based on the following concepts:

- There is a single base directory relative to which user-specific data files
  should be written. This directory is defined by the environment variable
  :code:`$XDG_DATA_HOME`.

- There is a single base directory relative to which user-specific configuration
  files should be written. This directory is defined by the environment variable
  :code:`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`.

- There is a set of preference ordered base directories relative to which data
  files should be searched. This set of directories is defined by the
  environment variable :code:`$XDG_DATA_DIRS`.

- There is a set of preference ordered base directories relative to which
  configuration files should be searched. This set of directories is defined by
  the environment variable :code:`$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS`.

- There is a single base directory relative to which user-specific non-essential
  (cached) data should be written. This directory is defined by the environment
  variable :code:`$XDG_CACHE_HOME`.

- There is a single base directory relative to which user-specific runtime files
  and other file objects should be placed. This directory is defined by the
  environment variable :code:`$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`.

All paths set in these environment variables must be absolute. If an
implementation encounters a relative path in any of these variables it should
consider the path invalid and ignore it.

        :code:`$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` defines the base directory relative to which
        user-specific non-essential runtime files and other file objects (such
        as sockets, named pipes, ...) should be stored. The directory MUST be
        owned by the user, and he MUST be the only one having read and write
        access to it. Its Unix access mode MUST be 0700.

        The lifetime of the directory MUST be bound to the user being logged in.
        It MUST be created when the user first logs in and if the user fully
        logs out the directory MUST be removed. If the user logs in more than
        once he should get pointed to the same directory, and it is mandatory
        that the directory continues to exist from his first login to his last
        logout on the system, and not removed in between. Files in the directory
        MUST not survive reboot or a full logout/login cycle.

        The directory MUST be on a local file system and not shared with any
        other system. The directory MUST by fully-featured by the standards of
        the operating system. More specifically, on Unix-like operating systems
        AF_UNIX sockets, symbolic links, hard links, proper permissions, file
        locking, sparse files, memory mapping, file change notifications, a
        reliable hard link count must be supported, and no restrictions on the
        file name character set should be imposed. Files in this directory MAY
        be subjected to periodic clean-up. To ensure that your files are not
        removed, they should have their access time timestamp modified at least
        once every 6 hours of monotonic time or the 'sticky' bit should be set
        on the file.

        If :code:`$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` is not set applications should fall back to
        a replacement directory with similar capabilities and print a warning
        message. Applications should use this directory for communication and
        synchronization purposes and should not place larger files in it, since
        it might reside in runtime memory and cannot necessarily be swapped out
        to disk.
