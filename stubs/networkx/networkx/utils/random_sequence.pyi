    Check if a degree sequence is valid for a tree.

    Two conditions must be met for a degree sequence to be valid for a tree:

    1. The number of nodes must be one more than the number of edges.
    2. The degree sequence must be trivial or have only strictly positive
       node degrees.

    Parameters
    ----------
    degree_sequence : iterable
        Iterable of node degrees.

    Returns
    -------
    bool
        Whether the degree sequence is valid for a tree.
    str
        Reason for invalidity, or dummy string if valid.

def zipf_rv(alpha, xmin: int = 1, seed=None) -> int:
    r"""
    Returns a random value chosen from the Zipf distribution.

    The return value is an integer drawn from the probability distribution

    .. math::

        p(x)=\frac{x^{-\alpha}}{\zeta(\alpha, x_{\min})},

    where $\zeta(\alpha, x_{\min})$ is the Hurwitz zeta function.

    Parameters
    ----------
    alpha : float
      Exponent value of the distribution
    xmin : int
      Minimum value
    seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)
        Indicator of random number generation state.
        See :ref:`Randomness<randomness>`.

    Returns
    -------
    x : int
      Random value from Zipf distribution

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError:
      If xmin < 1 or
      If alpha <= 1

    Notes
    -----
    The rejection algorithm generates random values for a the power-law
    distribution in uniformly bounded expected time dependent on
    parameters.  See [1]_ for details on its operation.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> nx.utils.zipf_rv(alpha=2, xmin=3, seed=42)
    8
