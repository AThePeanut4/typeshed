class Graph(Collection[_Node]):
    """
    Base class for undirected graphs.

    A Graph stores nodes and edges with optional data, or attributes.

    Graphs hold undirected edges.  Self loops are allowed but multiple
    (parallel) edges are not.

    Nodes can be arbitrary (hashable) Python objects with optional
    key/value attributes, except that `None` is not allowed as a node.

    Edges are represented as links between nodes with optional
    key/value attributes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    incoming_graph_data : input graph (optional, default: None)
        Data to initialize graph. If None (default) an empty
        graph is created.  The data can be any format that is supported
        by the to_networkx_graph() function, currently including edge list,
        dict of dicts, dict of lists, NetworkX graph, 2D NumPy array, SciPy
        sparse matrix, or PyGraphviz graph.

    attr : keyword arguments, optional (default= no attributes)
        Attributes to add to graph as key=value pairs.

    Examples
    --------
    Create an empty graph structure (a "null graph") with no nodes and
    no edges.

    >>> G = nx.Graph()

    G can be grown in several ways.

    **Nodes:**

    Add one node at a time:

    >>> G.add_node(1)

    Add the nodes from any container (a list, dict, set or
    even the lines from a file or the nodes from another graph).

    >>> G.add_nodes_from([2, 3])
    >>> G.add_nodes_from(range(100, 110))
    >>> H = nx.path_graph(10)
    >>> G.add_nodes_from(H)

    In addition to strings and integers any hashable Python object
    (except None) can represent a node, e.g. a customized node object,
    or even another Graph.

    >>> G.add_node(H)

    **Edges:**

    G can also be grown by adding edges.

    Add one edge,

    >>> G.add_edge(1, 2)

    a list of edges,

    >>> G.add_edges_from([(1, 2), (1, 3)])

    or a collection of edges,

    >>> G.add_edges_from(H.edges)

    If some edges connect nodes not yet in the graph, the nodes
    are added automatically.  There are no errors when adding
    nodes or edges that already exist.

    **Attributes:**

    Each graph, node, and edge can hold key/value attribute pairs
    in an associated attribute dictionary (the keys must be hashable).
    By default these are empty, but can be added or changed using
    add_edge, add_node or direct manipulation of the attribute
    dictionaries named graph, node and edge respectively.

    >>> G = nx.Graph(day="Friday")
    >>> G.graph
    {'day': 'Friday'}

    Add node attributes using add_node(), add_nodes_from() or G.nodes

    >>> G.add_node(1, time="5pm")
    >>> G.add_nodes_from([3], time="2pm")
    >>> G.nodes[1]
    {'time': '5pm'}
    >>> G.nodes[1]["room"] = 714  # node must exist already to use G.nodes
    >>> del G.nodes[1]["room"]  # remove attribute
    >>> list(G.nodes(data=True))
    [(1, {'time': '5pm'}), (3, {'time': '2pm'})]

    Add edge attributes using add_edge(), add_edges_from(), subscript
    notation, or G.edges.

    >>> G.add_edge(1, 2, weight=4.7)
    >>> G.add_edges_from([(3, 4), (4, 5)], color="red")
    >>> G.add_edges_from([(1, 2, {"color": "blue"}), (2, 3, {"weight": 8})])
    >>> G[1][2]["weight"] = 4.7
    >>> G.edges[1, 2]["weight"] = 4

    Warning: we protect the graph data structure by making `G.edges` a
    read-only dict-like structure. However, you can assign to attributes
    in e.g. `G.edges[1, 2]`. Thus, use 2 sets of brackets to add/change
    data attributes: `G.edges[1, 2]['weight'] = 4`
    (For multigraphs: `MG.edges[u, v, key][name] = value`).

    **Shortcuts:**

    Many common graph features allow python syntax to speed reporting.

    >>> 1 in G  # check if node in graph
    True
    >>> [n for n in G if n < 3]  # iterate through nodes
    [1, 2]
    >>> len(G)  # number of nodes in graph
    5

    Often the best way to traverse all edges of a graph is via the neighbors.
    The neighbors are reported as an adjacency-dict `G.adj` or `G.adjacency()`

    >>> for n, nbrsdict in G.adjacency():
    ...     for nbr, eattr in nbrsdict.items():
    ...         if "weight" in eattr:
    ...             # Do something useful with the edges
    ...             pass

    But the edges() method is often more convenient:

    >>> for u, v, weight in G.edges.data("weight"):
    ...     if weight is not None:
    ...         # Do something useful with the edges
    ...         pass

    **Reporting:**

    Simple graph information is obtained using object-attributes and methods.
    Reporting typically provides views instead of containers to reduce memory
    usage. The views update as the graph is updated similarly to dict-views.
    The objects `nodes`, `edges` and `adj` provide access to data attributes
    via lookup (e.g. `nodes[n]`, `edges[u, v]`, `adj[u][v]`) and iteration
    (e.g. `nodes.items()`, `nodes.data('color')`,
    `nodes.data('color', default='blue')` and similarly for `edges`)
    Views exist for `nodes`, `edges`, `neighbors()`/`adj` and `degree`.

    For details on these and other miscellaneous methods, see below.

    **Subclasses (Advanced):**

    The Graph class uses a dict-of-dict-of-dict data structure.
    The outer dict (node_dict) holds adjacency information keyed by node.
    The next dict (adjlist_dict) represents the adjacency information and holds
    edge data keyed by neighbor.  The inner dict (edge_attr_dict) represents
    the edge data and holds edge attribute values keyed by attribute names.

    Each of these three dicts can be replaced in a subclass by a user defined
    dict-like object. In general, the dict-like features should be
    maintained but extra features can be added. To replace one of the
    dicts create a new graph class by changing the class(!) variable
    holding the factory for that dict-like structure.

    node_dict_factory : function, (default: dict)
        Factory function to be used to create the dict containing node
        attributes, keyed by node id.
        It should require no arguments and return a dict-like object

    node_attr_dict_factory: function, (default: dict)
        Factory function to be used to create the node attribute
        dict which holds attribute values keyed by attribute name.
        It should require no arguments and return a dict-like object

    adjlist_outer_dict_factory : function, (default: dict)
        Factory function to be used to create the outer-most dict
        in the data structure that holds adjacency info keyed by node.
        It should require no arguments and return a dict-like object.

    adjlist_inner_dict_factory : function, (default: dict)
        Factory function to be used to create the adjacency list
        dict which holds edge data keyed by neighbor.
        It should require no arguments and return a dict-like object

    edge_attr_dict_factory : function, (default: dict)
        Factory function to be used to create the edge attribute
        dict which holds attribute values keyed by attribute name.
        It should require no arguments and return a dict-like object.

    graph_attr_dict_factory : function, (default: dict)
        Factory function to be used to create the graph attribute
        dict which holds attribute values keyed by attribute name.
        It should require no arguments and return a dict-like object.

    Typically, if your extension doesn't impact the data structure all
    methods will inherit without issue except: `to_directed/to_undirected`.
    By default these methods create a DiGraph/Graph class and you probably
    want them to create your extension of a DiGraph/Graph. To facilitate
    this we define two class variables that you can set in your subclass.

    to_directed_class : callable, (default: DiGraph or MultiDiGraph)
        Class to create a new graph structure in the `to_directed` method.
        If `None`, a NetworkX class (DiGraph or MultiDiGraph) is used.

    to_undirected_class : callable, (default: Graph or MultiGraph)
        Class to create a new graph structure in the `to_undirected` method.
        If `None`, a NetworkX class (Graph or MultiGraph) is used.

    **Subclassing Example**

    Create a low memory graph class that effectively disallows edge
    attributes by using a single attribute dict for all edges.
    This reduces the memory used, but you lose edge attributes.

    >>> class ThinGraph(nx.Graph):
    ...     all_edge_dict = {"weight": 1}
    ...
    ...     def single_edge_dict(self):
    ...         return self.all_edge_dict
    ...
    ...     edge_attr_dict_factory = single_edge_dict
    >>> G = ThinGraph()
    >>> G.add_edge(2, 1)
    >>> G[2][1]
    {'weight': 1}
    >>> G.add_edge(2, 2)
    >>> G[2][1] is G[2][2]
    True

        Update the graph using nodes/edges/graphs as input.

        Like dict.update, this method takes a graph as input, adding the
        graph's nodes and edges to this graph. It can also take two inputs:
        edges and nodes. Finally it can take either edges or nodes.
        To specify only nodes the keyword `nodes` must be used.

        The collections of edges and nodes are treated similarly to
        the add_edges_from/add_nodes_from methods. When iterated, they
        should yield 2-tuples (u, v) or 3-tuples (u, v, datadict).

        Parameters
        ----------
        edges : Graph object, collection of edges, or None
            The first parameter can be a graph or some edges. If it has
            attributes `nodes` and `edges`, then it is taken to be a
            Graph-like object and those attributes are used as collections
            of nodes and edges to be added to the graph.
            If the first parameter does not have those attributes, it is
            treated as a collection of edges and added to the graph.
            If the first argument is None, no edges are added.
        nodes : collection of nodes, or None
            The second parameter is treated as a collection of nodes
            to be added to the graph unless it is None.
            If `edges is None` and `nodes is None` an exception is raised.
            If the first parameter is a Graph, then `nodes` is ignored.

        Examples
        --------

        Returns True if the edge (u, v) is in the graph.

        This is the same as `v in G[u]` without KeyError exceptions.

        Parameters
        ----------
        u, v : nodes
            Nodes can be, for example, strings or numbers.
            Nodes must be hashable (and not None) Python objects.

        Returns
        -------
        edge_ind : bool
            True if edge is in the graph, False otherwise.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> G = nx.path_graph(4)  # or DiGraph, MultiGraph, MultiDiGraph, etc
        >>> G.has_edge(0, 1)  # using two nodes
        True

        The following syntax are equivalent:

        >>> G.has_edge(0, 1)
        True

        Parameters
        ----------
        u, v : nodes, optional (default=all edges)

        For undirected graphs, this method counts the total number of
        edges in the graph:

        >>> G = nx.path_graph(4)
        >>> G.number_of_edges()
        3

        If you specify two nodes, this counts the total number of edges
        joining the two nodes:

        >>> G.number_of_edges(0, 1)
        1

        For directed graphs, this method can count the total number of
        directed edges from `u` to `v`:

        >>> G = nx.DiGraph()
        >>> G.add_edge(0, 1)

        also in the graph.

        The nodes in an iterable nbunch are checked for membership in the graph

        Parameters
        ----------
        nbunch : single node, container, or all nodes (default= all nodes)
            The view will only report edges incident to these nodes.

        "if nbunch in self:", even after processing with this routine.

        If nbunch is not a node or a (possibly empty) sequence/iterator
        or None, a :exc:`NetworkXError` is raised.  Also, if any object in
        nbunch is not hashable, a :exc:`NetworkXError` is raised.
