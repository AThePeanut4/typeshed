"""
Implementation of the Wright, Richmond, Odlyzko and McKay (WROM)
algorithm for the enumeration of all non-isomorphic free trees of a
given order.  Rooted trees are represented by level sequences, i.e.,
lists in which the i-th element specifies the distance of vertex i to
the root.

    Generates lists of nonisomorphic trees

    Parameters
    ----------
    order : int
       order of the desired tree(s)

    create : one of {"graph", "matrix"} (default="graph")
       If ``"graph"`` is selected a list of ``Graph`` instances will be returned,
       if matrix is selected a list of adjacency matrices will be returned.

       .. deprecated:: 3.3

          The `create` argument is deprecated and will be removed in NetworkX
          version 3.5. In the future, `nonisomorphic_trees` will yield graph
          instances by default. To generate adjacency matrices, call
          ``nx.to_numpy_array`` on the output, e.g.::

             [nx.to_numpy_array(G) for G in nx.nonisomorphic_trees(N)]

    Yields
    ------
    list
       A list of nonisomorphic trees, in one of two formats depending on the
       value of the `create` parameter:
       - ``create="graph"``: yields a list of `networkx.Graph` instances
       - ``create="matrix"``: yields a list of list-of-lists representing adjacency matrices
