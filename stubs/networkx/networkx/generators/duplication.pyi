def partial_duplication_graph(N, n, p, q, seed=None):
    """
    Returns a random graph using the partial duplication model.

    Parameters
    ----------
    N : int
        The total number of nodes in the final graph.

    n : int
        The number of nodes in the initial clique.

    p : float
        The probability of joining each neighbor of a node to the
        duplicate node. Must be a number in the between zero and one,
        inclusive.

    q : float
        The probability of joining the source node to the duplicate
        node. Must be a number in the between zero and one, inclusive.

    seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)
        Indicator of random number generation state.
        See :ref:`Randomness<randomness>`.

    create_using : Graph constructor, optional (default=nx.Graph)
        Graph type to create. If graph instance, then cleared before populated.
        Multigraph and directed types are not supported and raise a ``NetworkXError``.

    Notes
    -----
    A graph of nodes is grown by creating a fully connected graph
    of size `n`. The following procedure is then repeated until
    a total of `N` nodes have been reached.

    1. A random node, *u*, is picked and a new node, *v*, is created.
    2. For each neighbor of *u* an edge from the neighbor to *v* is created
       with probability `p`.
    3. An edge from *u* to *v* is created with probability `q`.

    This algorithm appears in [1].

    This implementation allows the possibility of generating
    disconnected graphs.
