    Returns a connected caveman graph of `l` cliques of size `k`.

    The connected caveman graph is formed by creating `n` cliques of size

    adjacent clique.

    Parameters
    ----------
    l : int

    k : int
      size of cliques (k at least 2 or NetworkXError is raised)

    Defines a "ring of cliques" graph.

    A ring of cliques graph is consisting of cliques, connected through single

    Parameters
    ----------
    num_cliques : int
        Number of cliques
    clique_size : int
        Size of cliques

    simply adds the link without removing any link from the cliques.

def windmill_graph(n, k):
    """
    Generate a windmill graph.
    A windmill graph is a graph of `n` cliques each of size `k` that are all
    joined at one node.
    It can be thought of as taking a disjoint union of `n` cliques of size `k`,
    selecting one point from each, and contracting all of the selected points.
    Alternatively, one could generate `n` cliques of size `k-1` and one node
    that is connected to all other nodes in the graph.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n : int
        Number of cliques
    k : int
        Size of cliques

    Returns
    -------
    G : NetworkX Graph
        windmill graph with n cliques of size k

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
        If the number of cliques is less than two
        If the size of the cliques are less than two

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.windmill_graph(4, 5)

    Notes
    -----
    The node labeled `0` will be the node connected to all other nodes.
    Note that windmill graphs are usually denoted `Wd(k,n)`, so the parameters
    are in the opposite order as the parameters of this method.

    """
    Returns a stochastic block model graph.

    This model partitions the nodes in blocks of arbitrary sizes, and places
    edges between pairs of nodes independently, with a probability that depends
    on the blocks.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sizes : list of ints
        Sizes of blocks
    p : list of list of floats
        Element (r,s) gives the density of edges going from the nodes
        of group r to nodes of group s.
        p must match the number of groups (len(sizes) == len(p)),
        and it must be symmetric if the graph is undirected.
    nodelist : list, optional
        The block tags are assigned according to the node identifiers
        in nodelist. If nodelist is None, then the ordering is the
        range [0,sum(sizes)-1].
    seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)
        Indicator of random number generation state.
        See :ref:`Randomness<randomness>`.
    directed : boolean optional, default=False
        Whether to create a directed graph or not.
    selfloops : boolean optional, default=False
        Whether to include self-loops or not.
    sparse: boolean optional, default=True
        Use the sparse heuristic to speed up the generator.

    Returns
    -------
    g : NetworkX Graph or DiGraph
        Stochastic block model graph of size sum(sizes)

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
      If probabilities are not in [0,1].
      If the probability matrix is not square (directed case).
      If the probability matrix is not symmetric (undirected case).
      If the sizes list does not match nodelist or the probability matrix.
      If nodelist contains duplicate.

    --------
