Laplacian matrix of graphs.

All calculations here are done using the out-degree. For Laplacians using
in-degree, use `G.reverse(copy=False)` instead of `G` and take the transpose.

The `laplacian_matrix` function provides an unnormalized matrix,
while `normalized_laplacian_matrix`, `directed_laplacian_matrix`,
and `directed_combinatorial_laplacian_matrix` are all normalized.

    """
    Returns the Laplacian matrix of G.

    The graph Laplacian is the matrix L = D - A, where
    A is the adjacency matrix and D is the diagonal matrix of node degrees.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
       A NetworkX graph

    nodelist : list, optional
       The rows and columns are ordered according to the nodes in nodelist.
       If nodelist is None, then the ordering is produced by G.nodes().

    weight : string or None, optional (default='weight')
       The edge data key used to compute each value in the matrix.
       If None, then each edge has weight 1.

    Returns
    -------
    L : SciPy sparse array
      The Laplacian matrix of G.

    Notes
    -----
    For MultiGraph, the edges weights are summed.

    This returns an unnormalized matrix. For a normalized output,
    use `normalized_laplacian_matrix`, `directed_laplacian_matrix`,
    or `directed_combinatorial_laplacian_matrix`.

    This calculation uses the out-degree of the graph `G`. To use the
    in-degree for calculations instead, use `G.reverse(copy=False)` and
    take the transpose.

    :func:`~networkx.linalg.spectrum.laplacian_spectrum`

    Examples
    --------
    For graphs with multiple connected components, L is permutation-similar
    to a block diagonal matrix where each block is the respective Laplacian
    matrix for each component.

    >>> G = nx.Graph([(1, 2), (2, 3), (4, 5)])
    >>> print(nx.laplacian_matrix(G).toarray())
    [[ 1 -1  0  0  0]
     [-1  2 -1  0  0]
     [ 0 -1  1  0  0]
     [ 0  0  0  1 -1]
     [ 0  0  0 -1  1]]

    >>> edges = [
    ...     (1, 2),
    ...     (2, 1),
    ...     (2, 4),
    ...     (4, 3),
    ...     (3, 4),
    ... ]
    >>> DiG = nx.DiGraph(edges)
    >>> print(nx.laplacian_matrix(DiG).toarray())
    [[ 1 -1  0  0]
     [-1  2 -1  0]
     [ 0  0  1 -1]
     [ 0  0 -1  1]]

    Notice that node 4 is represented by the third column and row. This is because
    by default the row/column order is the order of `G.nodes` (i.e. the node added
    order -- in the edgelist, 4 first appears in (2, 4), before node 3 in edge (4, 3).)
    To control the node order of the matrix, use the `nodelist` argument.

    >>> print(nx.laplacian_matrix(DiG, nodelist=[1, 2, 3, 4]).toarray())
    [[ 1 -1  0  0]
     [-1  2  0 -1]
     [ 0  0  1 -1]
     [ 0  0 -1  1]]

    This calculation uses the out-degree of the graph `G`. To use the
    in-degree for calculations instead, use `G.reverse(copy=False)` and
    take the transpose.

    >>> print(nx.laplacian_matrix(DiG.reverse(copy=False)).toarray().T)
    [[ 1 -1  0  0]
     [-1  1 -1  0]
     [ 0  0  2 -1]

    Depending on the value of walk_type, `P` can be the transition matrix
    induced by a random walk, a lazy random walk, or a random walk with
    teleportation (PageRank).

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : DiGraph
       A NetworkX graph

    nodelist : list, optional
       The rows and columns are ordered according to the nodes in nodelist.

    weight : string or None, optional (default='weight')
       The edge data key used to compute each value in the matrix.
       If None, then each edge has weight 1.

    walk_type : string or None, optional (default=None)
       One of ``"random"``, ``"lazy"``, or ``"pagerank"``. If ``walk_type=None``
       (the default), then a value is selected according to the properties of `G`:
       - ``walk_type="random"`` if `G` is strongly connected and aperiodic
       - ``walk_type="lazy"`` if `G` is strongly connected but not aperiodic
       - ``walk_type="pagerank"`` for all other cases.

    alpha : real
       (1 - alpha) is the teleportation probability used with pagerank

    Returns
    -------
    L : NumPy matrix
      Normalized Laplacian of G.

    -----
    Only implemented for DiGraphs

    The result is always a symmetric matrix.
