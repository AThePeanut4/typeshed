Algorithm for testing d-separation in DAGs.

*d-separation* is a test for conditional independence in probability
distributions that can be factorized using DAGs.  It is a purely
graphical test that uses the underlying graph and makes no reference
to the actual distribution parameters.  See [1]_ for a formal
definition.

The implementation is based on the conceptually simple linear time
algorithm presented in [2]_.  Refer to [3]_, [4]_ for a couple of
alternative algorithms.

The functional interface in NetworkX consists of three functions:

- `find_minimal_d_separator` returns a minimal d-separator set ``z``.
  That is, removing any node or nodes from it makes it no longer a d-separator.
- `is_d_separator` checks if a given set is a d-separator.
- `is_minimal_d_separator` checks if a given set is a minimal d-separator.

D-separators
------------

Here, we provide a brief overview of d-separation and related concepts that
are relevant for understanding it:

The ideas of d-separation and d-connection relate to paths being open or blocked.

- A "path" is a sequence of nodes connected in order by edges. Unlike for most
  graph theory analysis, the direction of the edges is ignored. Thus the path
  can be thought of as a traditional path on the undirected version of the graph.
- A "candidate d-separator" ``z`` is a set of nodes being considered as
  possibly blocking all paths between two prescribed sets ``x`` and ``y`` of nodes.
  We refer to each node in the candidate d-separator as "known".
- A "collider" node on a path is a node that is a successor of its two neighbor
  nodes on the path. That is, ``c`` is a collider if the edge directions
  along the path look like ``... u -> c <- v ...``.
- If a collider node or any of its descendants are "known", the collider
  is called an "open collider". Otherwise it is a "blocking collider".
- Any path can be "blocked" in two ways. If the path contains a "known" node
  that is not a collider, the path is blocked. Also, if the path contains a
  collider that is not a "known" node, the path is blocked.
- A path is "open" if it is not blocked. That is, it is open if every node is
  either an open collider or not a "known". Said another way, every
  "known" in the path is a collider and every collider is open (has a
  "known" as a inclusive descendant). The concept of "open path" is meant to
  demonstrate a probabilistic conditional dependence between two nodes given
  prescribed knowledge ("known" nodes).
- Two sets ``x`` and ``y`` of nodes are "d-separated" by a set of nodes ``z``
  if all paths between nodes in ``x`` and nodes in ``y`` are blocked. That is,
  if there are no open paths from any node in ``x`` to any node in ``y``.
  Such a set ``z`` is a "d-separator" of ``x`` and ``y``.
- A "minimal d-separator" is a d-separator ``z`` for which no node or subset
  of nodes can be removed with it still being a d-separator.

The d-separator blocks some paths between ``x`` and ``y`` but opens others.
Nodes in the d-separator block paths if the nodes are not colliders.
But if a collider or its descendant nodes are in the d-separation set, the
colliders are open, allowing a path through that collider.

Illustration of D-separation with examples
------------------------------------------

A pair of two nodes, ``u`` and ``v``, are d-connected if there is a path
from ``u`` to ``v`` that is not blocked. That means, there is an open
path from ``u`` to ``v``.

For example, if the d-separating set is the empty set, then the following paths are
open between ``u`` and ``v``:

- u <- n -> v
- u -> w -> ... -> n -> v

If  on the other hand, ``n`` is in the d-separating set, then ``n`` blocks
those paths between ``u`` and ``v``.

Colliders block a path if they and their descendants are not included
in the d-separating set. An example of a path that is blocked when the
d-separating set is empty is:

- u -> w -> ... -> n <- v

The node ``n`` is a collider in this path and is not in the d-separating set.
So ``n`` blocks this path. However, if ``n`` or a descendant of ``n`` is
included in the d-separating set, then the path through the collider
at ``n`` (... -> n <- ...) is "open".

D-separation is concerned with blocking all paths between nodes from ``x`` to ``y``.
A d-separating set between ``x`` and ``y`` is one where all paths are blocked.

D-separation and its applications in probability
------------------------------------------------

D-separation is commonly used in probabilistic causal-graph models. D-separation
connects the idea of probabilistic "dependence" with separation in a graph. If
one assumes the causal Markov condition [5]_, (every node is conditionally
independent of its non-descendants, given its parents) then d-separation implies
conditional independence in probability distributions.
Symmetrically, d-connection implies dependence.

The intuition is as follows. The edges on a causal graph indicate which nodes
influence the outcome of other nodes directly. An edge from u to v
implies that the outcome of event ``u`` influences the probabilities for
the outcome of event ``v``. Certainly knowing ``u`` changes predictions for ``v``.
But also knowing ``v`` changes predictions for ``u``. The outcomes are dependent.
Furthermore, an edge from ``v`` to ``w`` would mean that ``w`` and ``v`` are dependent
and thus that ``u`` could indirectly influence ``w``.

Without any knowledge about the system (candidate d-separating set is empty)
a causal graph ``u -> v -> w`` allows all three nodes to be dependent. But
if we know the outcome of ``v``, the conditional probabilities of outcomes for
``u`` and ``w`` are independent of each other. That is, once we know the outcome
for ```v`, the probabilities for ``w`` do not depend on the outcome for ``u``.
This is the idea behind ``v`` blocking the path if it is "known" (in the candidate
d-separating set).

The same argument works whether the direction of the edges are both
left-going and when both arrows head out from the middle. Having a "known"
node on a path blocks the collider-free path because those relationships
make the conditional probabilities independent.

The direction of the causal edges does impact dependence precisely in the
case of a collider e.g. ``u -> v <- w``. In that situation, both ``u`` and ``w``
influence ``v```. But they do not directly influence each other. So without any
knowledge of any outcomes, ``u`` and ``w`` are independent. That is the idea behind
colliders blocking the path. But, if ``v`` is known, the conditional probabilities
of ``u`` and ``w`` can be dependent. This is the heart of Berkson's Paradox [6]_.
For example, suppose ``u`` and ``w`` are boolean events (they either happen or do not)
and ``v`` represents the outcome "at least one of ``u`` and ``w`` occur". Then knowing
``v`` is true makes the conditional probabilities of ``u`` and ``w`` dependent.
Essentially, knowing that at least one of them is true raises the probability of
each. But further knowledge that ``w`` is true (or false) change the conditional
probability of ``u`` to either the original value or 1. So the conditional
probability of ``u`` depends on the outcome of ``w`` even though there is no
causal relationship between them. When a collider is known, dependence can
occur across paths through that collider. This is the reason open colliders
do not block paths.

Furthermore, even if ``v`` is not "known", if one of its descendants is "known"
we can use that information to know more about ``v`` which again makes
``u`` and ``w`` potentially dependent. Suppose the chance of ``n`` occurring
is much higher when ``v`` occurs ("at least one of ``u`` and ``w`` occur").
Then if we know ``n`` occurred, it is more likely that ``v`` occurred and that
makes the chance of ``u`` and ``w`` dependent. This is the idea behind why
a collider does no block a path if any descendant of the collider is "known".

When two sets of nodes ``x`` and ``y`` are d-separated by a set ``z``,
it means that given the outcomes of the nodes in ``z``, the probabilities
of outcomes of the nodes in ``x`` are independent of the outcomes of the
nodes in ``y`` and vice versa.

Examples
--------
A Hidden Markov Model with 5 observed states and 5 hidden states
where the hidden states have causal relationships resulting in
a path results in the following causal network. We check that
early states along the path are separated from late state in
the path by the d-separator of the middle hidden state.
Thus if we condition on the middle hidden state, the early
state probabilities are independent of the late state outcomes.

False
>>> z = nx.find_minimal_d_separator(G, x | y, {"O2", "O3", "O4"})
>>> z == {"H2", "H4"}
True

If no minimal_d_separator exists, `None` is returned

>>> other_z = nx.find_minimal_d_separator(G, x | y, {"H2", "H3"})
>>> other_z is None
True

    Determine if `z` is a minimal d-separator for `x` and `y`.

    A d-separator, `z`, in a DAG is a set of nodes that blocks
    all paths from nodes in set `x` to nodes in set `y`.
    A minimal d-separator is a d-separator `z` such that removing
    any subset of nodes makes it no longer a d-separator.

    Note: This function checks whether `z` is a d-separator AND is
    minimal. One can use the function `is_d_separator` to only check if
    `z` is a d-separator. See examples below.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : nx.DiGraph
        A NetworkX DAG.
    x : node | set
        A node or set of nodes in the graph.
    y : node | set
        A node or set of nodes in the graph.
    z : node | set
        The node or set of nodes to check if it is a minimal d-separating set.
        The function :func:`is_d_separator` is called inside this function
        to verify that `z` is in fact a d-separator.
    included : set | node | None
        A node or set of nodes which must be included in the found separating set,
        default is ``None``, which means the empty set.
    restricted : set | node | None
        Restricted node or set of nodes to consider. Only these nodes can be in
        the found separating set, default is ``None`` meaning all nodes in ``G``.

    Returns
    -------
    bool
        Whether or not the set `z` is a minimal d-separator subject to
        `restricted` nodes and `included` node constraints.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.path_graph([0, 1, 2, 3], create_using=nx.DiGraph)
    >>> G.add_node(4)
    >>> nx.is_minimal_d_separator(G, 0, 2, {1})
    True
    >>> # since {1} is the minimal d-separator, {1, 3, 4} is not minimal
    >>> nx.is_minimal_d_separator(G, 0, 2, {1, 3, 4})
    False
    >>> # alternatively, if we only want to check that {1, 3, 4} is a d-separator
    >>> nx.is_d_separator(G, 0, 2, {1, 3, 4})
    True

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
        Raises a :exc:`NetworkXError` if the input graph is not a DAG.

    NodeNotFound
        If any of the input nodes are not found in the graph,
        a :exc:`NodeNotFound` exception is raised.

    Notes
    -----
    This function works on verifying that a set is minimal and
    d-separating between two nodes. Uses criterion (a), (b), (c) on
    page 4 of [1]_. a) closure(`x`) and `y` are disjoint. b) `z` contains
    all nodes from `included` and is contained in the `restricted`
    nodes and in the union of ancestors of `x`, `y`, and `included`.
    c) the nodes in `z` not in `included` are contained in both
    closure(x) and closure(y). The closure of a set is the set of nodes
    connected to the set by a directed path in G.

    The complexity is :math:`O(m)`, where :math:`m` stands for the
    number of edges in the subgraph of G consisting of only the
    ancestors of `x` and `y`.
