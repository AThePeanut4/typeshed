    Returns the reverse directed graph of G.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : directed graph
        A NetworkX directed graph
    copy : bool
        If True, then a new graph is returned. If False, then the graph is
        reversed in place.

    Returns
    -------
    H : directed graph
        The reversed G.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
        If graph is undirected.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.DiGraph([(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5)])
    >>> G_reversed = nx.reverse(G)
    >>> G_reversed.edges()
