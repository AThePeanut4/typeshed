@_dispatchable
def complement(G: Graph[_Node]):
    """
    Returns the graph complement of G.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
       A NetworkX graph

    Returns
    -------
    GC : A new graph.

    Notes
    -----
    Note that `complement` does not create self-loops and also
    does not produce parallel edges for MultiGraphs.

    Graph, node, and edge data are not propagated to the new graph.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.Graph([(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5)])
    >>> G_complement = nx.complement(G)
    >>> G_complement.edges()  # This shows the edges of the complemented graph
    EdgeView([(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (4, 5)])

@_dispatchable
def reverse(G: _G, copy: bool = True) -> _G:
    """
    Returns the reverse directed graph of G.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : directed graph
        A NetworkX directed graph
    copy : bool
        If True, then a new graph is returned. If False, then the graph is
        reversed in place.

    Returns
    -------
    H : directed graph
        The reversed G.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
        If graph is undirected.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.DiGraph([(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5)])
    >>> G_reversed = nx.reverse(G)
    >>> G_reversed.edges()
