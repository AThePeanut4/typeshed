def tensor_product(G: Graph[_X], H: Graph[_Y]) -> Graph[tuple[_X, _Y]]:
    r"""
    Returns the tensor product of G and H.

    The tensor product $P$ of the graphs $G$ and $H$ has a node set that
    is the Cartesian product of the node sets, $V(P)=V(G) \times V(H)$.
    $P$ has an edge $((u,v), (x,y))$ if and only if $(u,x)$ is an edge in $G$
    and $(v,y)$ is an edge in $H$.

    Tensor product is sometimes also referred to as the categorical product,
    direct product, cardinal product or conjunction.


    Parameters
    ----------
    G, H: graphs
     Networkx graphs.

    Returns
    -------
    P: NetworkX graph
     The tensor product of G and H. P will be a multi-graph if either G
     or H is a multi-graph, will be a directed if G and H are directed,
     and undirected if G and H are undirected.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
     If G and H are not both directed or both undirected.

    Notes
    -----
    Node attributes in P are two-tuple of the G and H node attributes.
    Missing attributes are assigned None.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.Graph()

def power(G: Graph[_Node], k):
    """
    Returns the specified power of a graph.

    The $k$th power of a simple graph $G$, denoted $G^k$, is a
    graph on the same set of nodes in which two distinct nodes $u$ and
    $v$ are adjacent in $G^k$ if and only if the shortest path
    distance between $u$ and $v$ in $G$ is at most $k$.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
        A NetworkX simple graph object.

    k : positive integer
        The power to which to raise the graph `G`.

    Returns
    -------
    NetworkX simple graph
        `G` to the power `k`.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the exponent `k` is not positive.

    NetworkXNotImplemented
        If `G` is not a simple graph.

    Examples
    --------
    The number of edges will never decrease when taking successive
    powers:

    >>> G = nx.path_graph(4)
    >>> list(nx.power(G, 2).edges)
    [(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)]
    >>> list(nx.power(G, 3).edges)
    [(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)]

    The `k` th power of a cycle graph on *n* nodes is the complete graph
    on *n* nodes, if `k` is at least ``n // 2``:

    >>> G = nx.cycle_graph(5)
    >>> H = nx.complete_graph(5)
    >>> nx.is_isomorphic(nx.power(G, 2), H)
    True
    >>> G = nx.cycle_graph(8)
    >>> H = nx.complete_graph(8)
    >>> nx.is_isomorphic(nx.power(G, 4), H)
    True

def rooted_product(G: Graph[_X], H: Graph[_Y], root: _Y) -> Graph[tuple[_X, _Y]]:
    """
    Return the rooted product of graphs G and H rooted at root in H.

    A new graph is constructed representing the rooted product of
    the inputted graphs, G and H, with a root in H.
    A rooted product duplicates H for each nodes in G with the root
    of H corresponding to the node in G. Nodes are renamed as the direct
    product of G and H. The result is a subgraph of the cartesian product.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G,H : graph
       A NetworkX graph
    root : node
       A node in H

    Returns
