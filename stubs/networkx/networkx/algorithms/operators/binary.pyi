def disjoint_union(G: Graph[_Node], H: Graph[_Node]):
    """
    Combine graphs G and H. The nodes are assumed to be unique (disjoint).

    This algorithm automatically relabels nodes to avoid name collisions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G,H : graph
       A NetworkX graph

    Returns
    -------
    U : A union graph with the same type as G.

    See Also
    --------
    union
    compose
    :func:`~networkx.Graph.update`

    Notes
    -----
    A new graph is created, of the same class as G.  It is recommended
    that G and H be either both directed or both undirected.

    The nodes of G are relabeled 0 to len(G)-1, and the nodes of H are
    relabeled len(G) to len(G)+len(H)-1.

    Renumbering forces G and H to be disjoint, so no exception is ever raised for a name collision.
    To preserve the check for common nodes, use union().

    Edge and node attributes are propagated from G and H to the union graph.
    Graph attributes are also propagated, but if they are present in both G and H,
    then the value from H is used.

    To combine graphs that have common nodes, consider compose(G, H)
    or the method, Graph.update().

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.Graph([(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2)])
    >>> H = nx.Graph([(0, 3), (1, 2), (2, 3)])
    >>> G.nodes[0]["key1"] = 5
    >>> H.nodes[0]["key2"] = 10
    >>> U = nx.disjoint_union(G, H)
    >>> U.nodes(data=True)
    NodeDataView({0: {'key1': 5}, 1: {}, 2: {}, 3: {'key2': 10}, 4: {}, 5: {}, 6: {}})
    >>> U.edges
    EdgeView([(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (3, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6)])

@_dispatchable
def intersection(G: Graph[_Node], H: Graph[_Node]):
    """
    Returns a new graph that contains only the nodes and the edges that exist in
    both G and H.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G,H : graph
       A NetworkX graph. G and H can have different node sets but must be both graphs or both multigraphs.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
        If one is a MultiGraph and the other one is a graph.

    Returns
    -------
    GH : A new graph with the same type as G.

    Notes
    -----
    Attributes from the graph, nodes, and edges are not copied to the new
    graph.  If you want a new graph of the intersection of G and H
    with the attributes (including edge data) from G use remove_nodes_from()
    as follows

    >>> G = nx.path_graph(3)
    >>> H = nx.path_graph(5)
    >>> R = G.copy()
    >>> R.remove_nodes_from(n for n in G if n not in H)
    >>> R.remove_edges_from(e for e in G.edges if e not in H.edges)

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.Graph([(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2)])
    >>> H = nx.Graph([(0, 3), (1, 2), (2, 3)])
    >>> R = nx.intersection(G, H)

def difference(G: Graph[_Node], H: Graph[_Node]):
    """
    Returns a new graph that contains the edges that exist in G but not in H.
