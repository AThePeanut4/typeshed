def disjoint_union(G: Graph[_Node], H: Graph[_Node]):
    """
    Combine graphs G and H. The nodes are assumed to be unique (disjoint).

    This algorithm automatically relabels nodes to avoid name collisions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G,H : graph
       A NetworkX graph

    Returns
    -------
    U : A union graph with the same type as G.

    :func:`~networkx.Graph.update`

    Notes
    -----
    A new graph is created, of the same class as G.  It is recommended
    that G and H be either both directed or both undirected.

    The nodes of G are relabeled 0 to len(G)-1, and the nodes of H are
    relabeled len(G) to len(G)+len(H)-1.

    Renumbering forces G and H to be disjoint, so no exception is ever raised for a name collision.
    To preserve the check for common nodes, use union().

    Edge and node attributes are propagated from G and H to the union graph.
    Graph attributes are also propagated, but if they are present in both G and H,
    then the value from H is used.

    To combine graphs that have common nodes, consider compose(G, H)
    or the method, Graph.update().

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.Graph([(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2)])
    >>> H = nx.Graph([(0, 3), (1, 2), (2, 3)])
    >>> G.nodes[0]["key1"] = 5
    >>> H.nodes[0]["key2"] = 10

def intersection(G: Graph[_Node], H: Graph[_Node]):
    """
    Returns a new graph that contains only the nodes and the edges that exist in

    Parameters
    ----------
    G,H : graph

def compose(G: Graph[_X], H: Graph[_Y]) -> DiGraph[_X | _Y]:
    """
    Compose graph G with H by combining nodes and edges into a single graph.

    The node sets and edges sets do not need to be disjoint.

    Composing preserves the attributes of nodes and edges.
    Attribute values from H take precedent over attribute values from G.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G, H : graph
       A NetworkX graph

    Returns
    -------
    C: A new graph with the same type as G

    See Also

    union
    disjoint_union

    Notes
    -----
    It is recommended that G and H be either both directed or both undirected.

    For MultiGraphs, the edges are identified by incident nodes AND edge-key.
    This can cause surprises (i.e., edge `(1, 2)` may or may not be the same
    in two graphs) if you use MultiGraph without keeping track of edge keys.

    If combining the attributes of common nodes is not desired, consider union(),
    which raises an exception for name collisions.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.Graph([(0, 1), (0, 2)])
    >>> H = nx.Graph([(0, 1), (1, 2)])
    >>> R = nx.compose(G, H)
    >>> R.nodes
    NodeView((0, 1, 2))
    >>> R.edges
    EdgeView([(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2)])

    By default, the attributes from `H` take precedent over attributes from `G`.
    If you prefer another way of combining attributes, you can update them after the compose operation:

    >>> G = nx.Graph([(0, 1, {"weight": 2.0}), (3, 0, {"weight": 100.0})])
    >>> H = nx.Graph([(0, 1, {"weight": 10.0}), (1, 2, {"weight": -1.0})])
    >>> nx.set_node_attributes(G, {0: "dark", 1: "light", 3: "black"}, name="color")
    >>> nx.set_node_attributes(H, {0: "green", 1: "orange", 2: "yellow"}, name="color")
    >>> GcomposeH = nx.compose(G, H)

    Normally, color attribute values of nodes of GcomposeH come from H. We can workaround this as follows:

    >>> node_data = {
    ...     n: G.nodes[n]["color"] + " " + H.nodes[n]["color"]
    ...     for n in G.nodes & H.nodes
    ... }
    >>> nx.set_node_attributes(GcomposeH, node_data, "color")
    >>> print(GcomposeH.nodes[0]["color"])
    dark green

    >>> print(GcomposeH.nodes[3]["color"])
    black

    Similarly, we can update edge attributes after the compose operation in a way we prefer:

    >>> edge_data = {
    ...     e: G.edges[e]["weight"] * H.edges[e]["weight"] for e in G.edges & H.edges
    ... }
    >>> nx.set_edge_attributes(GcomposeH, edge_data, "weight")
    >>> print(GcomposeH.edges[(0, 1)]["weight"])
    20.0

    >>> print(GcomposeH.edges[(3, 0)]["weight"])
    100.0

def union(G: Graph[_X], H: Graph[_Y], rename: Iterable[Incomplete] | None = ()) -> DiGraph[_X | _Y]:
    """
    Combine graphs G and H. The names of nodes must be unique.

    A name collision between the graphs will raise an exception.

    A renaming facility is provided to avoid name collisions.


    Parameters
    ----------
    G, H : graph
       A NetworkX graph

    rename : iterable , optional
       Node names of G and H can be changed by specifying the tuple
       rename=('G-','H-') (for example).  Node "u" in G is then renamed
       "G-u" and "v" in H is renamed "H-v".

    Returns
    -------
    U : A union graph with the same type as G.

    disjoint_union

    Notes
    -----
    To combine graphs that have common nodes, consider compose(G, H)
    or the method, Graph.update().

    disjoint_union() is similar to union() except that it avoids name clashes
    by relabeling the nodes with sequential integers.

    Edge and node attributes are propagated from G and H to the union graph.
    Graph attributes are also propagated, but if they are present in both G and H,
    then the value from H is used.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.Graph([(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2)])
    >>> H = nx.Graph([(0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 3), (1, 2)])
