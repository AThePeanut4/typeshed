    A topological sort is a nonunique permutation of the nodes of a

    valid only if the graph has no directed cycles.

    Parameters

    If your DiGraph naturally has the edges representing tasks/inputs
    and nodes representing people/processes that initiate tasks, then
    topological_sort is not quite what you need. You will have to change
    the tasks to nodes with dependence reflected by edges. The result is
    a kind of topological sort of the edges. This can be done
    with :func:`networkx.line_graph` as follows:

    """
    Generate the nodes in the unique lexicographical topological sort order.

    Generates a unique ordering of nodes by first sorting topologically (for which there are often
    multiple valid orderings) and then additionally by sorting lexicographically.

    A topological sort arranges the nodes of a directed graph so that the
    upstream node of each directed edge precedes the downstream node.
    It is always possible to find a solution for directed graphs that have no cycles.
    There may be more than one valid solution.

    Lexicographical sorting is just sorting alphabetically. It is used here to break ties in the
    topological sort and to determine a single, unique ordering.  This can be useful in comparing
    sort results.

    The lexicographical order can be customized by providing a function to the `key=` parameter.
    The definition of the key function is the same as used in python's built-in `sort()`.
    The function takes a single argument and returns a key to use for sorting purposes.

    Lexicographical sorting can fail if the node names are un-sortable. See the example below.
    The solution is to provide a function to the `key=` argument that returns sortable keys.


    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX digraph
        A directed acyclic graph (DAG)

    key : function, optional
        A function of one argument that converts a node name to a comparison key.
        It defines and resolves ambiguities in the sort order.  Defaults to the identity function.

    Yields
    ------
    nodes
        Yields the nodes of G in lexicographical topological sort order.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
        Topological sort is defined for directed graphs only. If the graph `G`
        is undirected, a :exc:`NetworkXError` is raised.

    NetworkXUnfeasible
        If `G` is not a directed acyclic graph (DAG) no topological sort exists
        and a :exc:`NetworkXUnfeasible` exception is raised.  This can also be
        raised if `G` is changed while the returned iterator is being processed

    RuntimeError
        If `G` is changed while the returned iterator is being processed.

    TypeError
        Results from un-sortable node names.
        Consider using `key=` parameter to resolve ambiguities in the sort order.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> DG = nx.DiGraph([(2, 1), (2, 5), (1, 3), (1, 4), (5, 4)])
    >>> list(nx.lexicographical_topological_sort(DG))
    [2, 1, 3, 5, 4]
    >>> list(nx.lexicographical_topological_sort(DG, key=lambda x: -x))
    [2, 5, 1, 4, 3]

    The sort will fail for any graph with integer and string nodes. Comparison of integer to strings
    is not defined in python.  Is 3 greater or less than 'red'?

    >>> DG = nx.DiGraph([(1, "red"), (3, "red"), (1, "green"), (2, "blue")])
    >>> list(nx.lexicographical_topological_sort(DG))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'str' and 'int'
    ...

    Incomparable nodes can be resolved using a `key` function. This example function
    allows comparison of integers and strings by returning a tuple where the first
    element is True for `str`, False otherwise. The second element is the node name.
    This groups the strings and integers separately so they can be compared only among themselves.

    >>> key = lambda node: (isinstance(node, str), node)
    >>> list(nx.lexicographical_topological_sort(DG, key=key))
    [1, 2, 3, 'blue', 'green', 'red']

def is_aperiodic(G: DiGraph[_Node]) -> bool:

    Returns True if `G` is aperiodic.

    A strongly connected directed graph is aperiodic if there is no integer ``k > 1``
    that divides the length of every cycle in the graph.

    This function requires the graph `G` to be strongly connected and will raise
    an error if it's not. For graphs that are not strongly connected, you should
    first identify their strongly connected components
    (using :func:`~networkx.algorithms.components.strongly_connected_components`)
    or attracting components
    (using :func:`~networkx.algorithms.components.attracting_components`),
    and then apply this function to those individual components.

    ----------
    G : NetworkX DiGraph
        A directed graph

    Returns
    -------
    bool
        True if the graph is aperiodic False otherwise

    NetworkXError
        If `G` is not strongly connected
    NetworkXPointlessConcept
        If `G` has no nodes

    Examples
    --------
    A graph consisting of one cycle, the length of which is 2. Therefore ``k = 2``
    divides the length of every cycle in the graph and thus the graph
    is *not aperiodic*::

        >>> DG = nx.DiGraph([(1, 2), (2, 1)])
        >>> nx.is_aperiodic(DG)
        False

    A graph consisting of two cycles: one of length 2 and the other of length 3.
    The cycle lengths are coprime, so there is no single value of k where ``k > 1``
    that divides each cycle length and therefore the graph is *aperiodic*::

        >>> DG = nx.DiGraph([(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (1, 4), (4, 1)])
        >>> nx.is_aperiodic(DG)
        True

    A graph created from cycles of the same length can still be aperiodic since
    the cycles can overlap and form new cycles of different lengths. For example,
    the following graph contains a cycle ``[4, 2, 3, 1]`` of length 4, which is coprime
    with the explicitly added cycles of length 3, so the graph is aperiodic::

        >>> DG = nx.DiGraph()
        >>> nx.add_cycle(DG, [1, 2, 3])
        >>> nx.add_cycle(DG, [2, 1, 4])
        >>> nx.is_aperiodic(DG)
        True

    A single-node graph's aperiodicity depends on whether it has a self-loop:
    it is aperiodic if a self-loop exists, and periodic otherwise::

        >>> G = nx.DiGraph()
        >>> G.add_node(1)
        >>> nx.is_aperiodic(G)
        False
        >>> G.add_edge(1, 1)
        >>> nx.is_aperiodic(G)
        True

    A Markov chain can be modeled as a directed graph, with nodes representing
    states and edges representing transitions with non-zero probability.
    Aperiodicity is typically considered for irreducible Markov chains,
    which are those that are *strongly connected* as graphs.

    The following Markov chain is irreducible and aperiodic, and thus
    ergodic. It is guaranteed to have a unique stationary distribution::

        >>> G = nx.DiGraph()
        >>> nx.add_cycle(G, [1, 2, 3, 4])
        >>> G.add_edge(1, 3)
        >>> nx.is_aperiodic(G)
        True

    Reducible Markov chains can sometimes have a unique stationary distribution.
    This occurs if the chain has exactly one closed communicating class and
    that class itself is aperiodic (see [1]_). You can use
    :func:`~networkx.algorithms.components.attracting_components`
    to find these closed communicating classes::

        >>> G = nx.DiGraph([(1, 3), (2, 3)])
        >>> nx.add_cycle(G, [3, 4, 5, 6])
        >>> nx.add_cycle(G, [3, 5, 6])
        >>> communicating_classes = list(nx.strongly_connected_components(G))
        >>> len(communicating_classes)
        3
        >>> closed_communicating_classes = list(nx.attracting_components(G))
        >>> len(closed_communicating_classes)
        1
        >>> nx.is_aperiodic(G.subgraph(closed_communicating_classes[0]))
        True

    given $m$ edges in `G`.

def transitive_closure(G: Graph[_Node], reflexive=False) -> Graph[_Node]:

    Returns transitive closure of a graph

    The transitive closure of G = (V,E) is a graph G+ = (V,E+) such that
    for all v, w in V there is an edge (v, w) in E+ if and only if there
    is a path from v to w in G.

    Handling of paths from v to v has some flexibility within this definition.
    A reflexive transitive closure creates a self-loop for the path
    from v to v of length 0. The usual transitive closure creates a
    self-loop only if a cycle exists (a path from v to v with length > 0).
    We also allow an option for no self-loops.

    G : NetworkX Graph
        A directed/undirected graph/multigraph.
    reflexive : Bool or None, optional (default: False)

        If True, trivial cycles (length 0) create self-loops. The result

        If False (the default) non-trivial cycles create self-loops.
        If None, self-loops are not created.

    Examples
    --------
    The treatment of trivial (i.e. length 0) cycles is controlled by the
    `reflexive` parameter.

    Trivial (i.e. length 0) cycles do not create self-loops when
    ``reflexive=False`` (the default)::

        >>> DG = nx.DiGraph([(1, 2), (2, 3)])
        >>> TC = nx.transitive_closure(DG, reflexive=False)
        >>> TC.edges()
        OutEdgeView([(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)])

    However, nontrivial (i.e. length greater than 0) cycles create self-loops
    when ``reflexive=False`` (the default)::

        >>> DG = nx.DiGraph([(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1)])
        >>> TC = nx.transitive_closure(DG, reflexive=False)
        >>> TC.edges()

    Trivial cycles (length 0) create self-loops when ``reflexive=True``::

        >>> DG = nx.DiGraph([(1, 2), (2, 3)])

        OutEdgeView([(1, 2), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 2), (3, 3)])

    And the third option is not to create self-loops at all when ``reflexive=None``::

        >>> TC = nx.transitive_closure(DG, reflexive=None)

    Examples
    --------
    To perform transitive reduction on a DiGraph:

    >>> DG = nx.DiGraph([(1, 2), (2, 3), (1, 3)])
    >>> TR = nx.transitive_reduction(DG)
    >>> list(TR.edges)
    [(1, 2), (2, 3)]

    To avoid unnecessary data copies, this implementation does not return a
    DiGraph with node/edge data.
    To perform transitive reduction on a DiGraph and transfer node/edge data:

    >>> DG = nx.DiGraph()
    >>> DG.add_edges_from([(1, 2), (2, 3), (1, 3)], color="red")
    >>> TR = nx.transitive_reduction(DG)
    >>> TR.add_nodes_from(DG.nodes(data=True))
    >>> TR.add_edges_from((u, v, DG.edges[u, v]) for u, v in TR.edges)
    >>> list(TR.edges(data=True))
    [(1, 2, {'color': 'red'}), (2, 3, {'color': 'red'})]

def dag_to_branching(G: Graph[_Node]) -> DiGraph[_Node]:
    """
    Returns a branching representing all (overlapping) paths from
    root nodes to leaf nodes in the given directed acyclic graph.

    As described in :mod:`networkx.algorithms.tree.recognition`, a
    *branching* is a directed forest in which each node has at most one
    parent. In other words, a branching is a disjoint union of
    *arborescences*. For this function, each node of in-degree zero in
    `G` becomes a root of one of the arborescences, and there will be
    one leaf node for each distinct path from that root to a leaf node
    in `G`.

    Each node `v` in `G` with *k* parents becomes *k* distinct nodes in
    the returned branching, one for each parent, and the sub-DAG rooted
    at `v` is duplicated for each copy. The algorithm then recurses on
    the children of each copy of `v`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
        A directed acyclic graph.

    Returns
    -------
    DiGraph
        The branching in which there is a bijection between root-to-leaf
        paths in `G` (in which multiple paths may share the same leaf)
        and root-to-leaf paths in the branching (in which there is a
        unique path from a root to a leaf).

        Each node has an attribute 'source' whose value is the original
        node to which this node corresponds. No other graph, node, or
        edge attributes are copied into this new graph.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXNotImplemented
        If `G` is not directed, or if `G` is a multigraph.

    HasACycle
        If `G` is not acyclic.

    Examples
    --------
    To examine which nodes in the returned branching were produced by
    which original node in the directed acyclic graph, we can collect
    the mapping from source node to new nodes into a dictionary. For
    example, consider the directed diamond graph::

        >>> from collections import defaultdict
        >>> from operator import itemgetter
        >>>
        >>> G = nx.DiGraph(nx.utils.pairwise("abd"))
        >>> G.add_edges_from(nx.utils.pairwise("acd"))
        >>> B = nx.dag_to_branching(G)
        >>>
        >>> sources = defaultdict(set)
        >>> for v, source in B.nodes(data="source"):
        ...     sources[source].add(v)
        >>> len(sources["a"])
        1
        >>> len(sources["d"])
        2

    To copy node attributes from the original graph to the new graph,
    you can use a dictionary like the one constructed in the above
    example::

        >>> for source, nodes in sources.items():
        ...     for v in nodes:
        ...         B.nodes[v].update(G.nodes[source])

    Notes
    -----
    This function is not idempotent in the sense that the node labels in
    the returned branching may be uniquely generated each time the
    function is invoked. In fact, the node labels may not be integers;
    in order to relabel the nodes to be more readable, you can use the
    :func:`networkx.convert_node_labels_to_integers` function.

    The current implementation of this function uses
    :func:`networkx.prefix_tree`, so it is subject to the limitations of
    that function.
    """

@_dispatchable
def compute_v_structures(G) -> Generator[tuple[Incomplete, Incomplete, Incomplete]]:
    """
    Yields 3-node tuples that represent the v-structures in `G`.

    .. deprecated:: 3.4

       `compute_v_structures` actually yields colliders. It will be removed in
       version 3.6. Use `nx.dag.v_structures` or `nx.dag.colliders` instead.

    Colliders are triples in the directed acyclic graph (DAG) where two parent nodes
    point to the same child node. V-structures are colliders where the two parent
    nodes are not adjacent. In a causal graph setting, the parents do not directly
    depend on each other, but conditioning on the child node provides an association.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
        A networkx `~networkx.DiGraph`.

    Yields
    ------
    A 3-tuple representation of a v-structure
        Each v-structure is a 3-tuple with the parent, collider, and other parent.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXNotImplemented
        If `G` is an undirected graph.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.DiGraph([(1, 2), (0, 4), (3, 1), (2, 4), (0, 5), (4, 5), (1, 5)])
    >>> nx.is_directed_acyclic_graph(G)
    True
    >>> list(nx.compute_v_structures(G))

    --------
    v_structures
    colliders

    Notes
    -----
    This function was written to be used on DAGs, however it works on cyclic graphs
    too. Since colliders are referred to in the cyclic causal graph literature
    [2]_ we allow cyclic graphs in this function. It is suggested that you test if
    your input graph is acyclic as in the example if you want that property.
