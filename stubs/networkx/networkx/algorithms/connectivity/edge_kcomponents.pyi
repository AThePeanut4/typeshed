Algorithms for finding k-edge-connected components and subgraphs.

A k-edge-connected component (k-edge-cc) is a maximal set of nodes in G, such
that all pairs of node have an edge-connectivity of at least k.

A k-edge-connected subgraph (k-edge-subgraph) is a maximal set of nodes in G,
such that the subgraph of G defined by the nodes has an edge-connectivity at
least k.

    A simple algorithm to find all k-edge-connected components in a graph.

    Constructing the auxiliary graph (which may take some time) allows for the
    k-edge-ccs to be found in linear time for arbitrary k.

    Notes
    -----
    This implementation is based on [1]_. The idea is to construct an auxiliary
    graph from which the k-edge-ccs can be extracted in linear time. The
    auxiliary graph is constructed in $O(|V|\cdot F)$ operations, where F is the
    complexity of max flow. Querying the components takes an additional $O(|V|)$
    operations. This algorithm can be slow for large graphs, but it handles an
    arbitrary k and works for both directed and undirected inputs.

    The undirected case for k=1 is exactly connected components.
    The undirected case for k=2 is exactly bridge connected components.
    The directed case for k=1 is exactly strongly connected components.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import itertools as it
    >>> from networkx.utils import pairwise
    >>> from networkx.algorithms.connectivity import EdgeComponentAuxGraph
    >>> # Build an interesting graph with multiple levels of k-edge-ccs
    >>> paths = [
    ...     (1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 3, 4, 2),  # a 3-edge-cc (a 4 clique)
    ...     (5, 6, 7, 5),  # a 2-edge-cc (a 3 clique)
    ...     (1, 5),  # combine first two ccs into a 1-edge-cc
    ...     (0,),  # add an additional disconnected 1-edge-cc
    ... ]
    >>> G = nx.Graph()
    >>> G.add_nodes_from(it.chain(*paths))
    >>> G.add_edges_from(it.chain(*[pairwise(path) for path in paths]))
    >>> # Constructing the AuxGraph takes about O(n ** 4)
    >>> aux_graph = EdgeComponentAuxGraph.construct(G)
    >>> # Once constructed, querying takes O(n)
    >>> sorted(map(sorted, aux_graph.k_edge_components(k=1)))
    [[0], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]]
    >>> sorted(map(sorted, aux_graph.k_edge_components(k=2)))
    [[0], [1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7]]
    >>> sorted(map(sorted, aux_graph.k_edge_components(k=3)))
    [[0], [1, 2, 3, 4], [5], [6], [7]]
    >>> sorted(map(sorted, aux_graph.k_edge_components(k=4)))
    [[0], [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7]]

    The auxiliary graph is primarily used for k-edge-ccs but it
    can also speed up the queries of k-edge-subgraphs by refining the
    search space.
