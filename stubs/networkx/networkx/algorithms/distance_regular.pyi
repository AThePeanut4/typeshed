def is_distance_regular(G: Graph[_Node]) -> bool:
    """
    Returns True if the graph is distance regular, False otherwise.

    A connected graph G is distance-regular if for any nodes x,y
    and any integers i,j=0,1,...,d (where d is the graph
    diameter), the number of vertices at distance i from x and
    distance j from y depends only on i,j and the graph distance
    between x and y, independently of the choice of x and y.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G: Networkx graph (undirected)

    Returns
    -------
    bool
      True if the graph is Distance Regular, False otherwise

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.hypercube_graph(6)
    >>> nx.is_distance_regular(G)
    True

def global_parameters(b, c) -> Generator[tuple[Incomplete, Incomplete, Incomplete]]:
    """
    Returns global parameters for a given intersection array.

    Given a distance-regular graph G with integers b_i, c_i,i = 0,....,d
    such that for any 2 vertices x,y in G at a distance i=d(x,y), there
    are exactly c_i neighbors of y at a distance of i-1 from x and b_i
    neighbors of y at a distance of i+1 from x.

    Thus, a distance regular graph has the global parameters,
    [[c_0,a_0,b_0],[c_1,a_1,b_1],......,[c_d,a_d,b_d]] for the
    intersection array  [b_0,b_1,.....b_{d-1};c_1,c_2,.....c_d]
    where a_i+b_i+c_i=k , k= degree of every vertex.

    Parameters
    ----------
    b : list

    c : list

    Returns
    -------
    iterable
       An iterable over three tuples.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.dodecahedral_graph()
    >>> b, c = nx.intersection_array(G)
    >>> list(nx.global_parameters(b, c))
    [(0, 0, 3), (1, 0, 2), (1, 1, 1), (1, 1, 1), (2, 0, 1), (3, 0, 0)]

    Returns the intersection array of a distance-regular graph.

    Given a distance-regular graph G with integers b_i, c_i,i = 0,....,d

    A distance regular graph's intersection array is given by,

def is_strongly_regular(G: Graph[_Node]) -> bool:
    """
    Returns True if and only if the given graph is strongly
    regular.

    An undirected graph is *strongly regular* if

    * it is regular,
    * each pair of adjacent vertices has the same number of neighbors in
      common,
    * each pair of nonadjacent vertices has the same number of neighbors
      in common.

    Each strongly regular graph is a distance-regular graph.
    Conversely, if a distance-regular graph has diameter two, then it is
    a strongly regular graph. For more information on distance-regular
    graphs, see :func:`is_distance_regular`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
        An undirected graph.

    Returns
    -------
    bool
        Whether `G` is strongly regular.

    Examples
    --------

    The cycle graph on five vertices is strongly regular. It is
    two-regular, each pair of adjacent vertices has no shared neighbors,
    and each pair of nonadjacent vertices has one shared neighbor::

        >>> G = nx.cycle_graph(5)
        >>> nx.is_strongly_regular(G)
