"""
Functions for estimating the small-world-ness of graphs.

A small world network is characterized by a small average shortest path length,
and a large clustering coefficient.

Small-worldness is commonly measured with the coefficient sigma or omega.

Both coefficients compare the average clustering coefficient and shortest path
length of a given graph against the same quantities for an equivalent random
or lattice graph.

For more information, see the Wikipedia article on small-world network [1]_.

    """
    Returns the small-world coefficient (sigma) of the given graph.

    The small-world coefficient is defined as:
    sigma = C/Cr / L/Lr
    where C and L are respectively the average clustering coefficient and
    average shortest path length of G. Cr and Lr are respectively the average
    clustering coefficient and average shortest path length of an equivalent
    random graph.

    A graph is commonly classified as small-world if sigma>1.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
        An undirected graph.
    niter : integer (optional, default=100)
        Approximate number of rewiring per edge to compute the equivalent
        random graph.
    nrand : integer (optional, default=10)
        Number of random graphs generated to compute the average clustering

def omega(G: Graph[_Node], niter: int = 5, nrand: int = 10, seed: int | RandomState | None = None) -> float:
    """
    Returns the small-world coefficient (omega) of a graph

    The small-world coefficient of a graph G is:

    omega = Lr/L - C/Cl

    where C and L are respectively the average clustering coefficient and
    average shortest path length of G. Lr is the average shortest path length
    of an equivalent random graph and Cl is the average clustering coefficient
    of an equivalent lattice graph.

    The small-world coefficient (omega) measures how much G is like a lattice
    or a random graph. Negative values mean G is similar to a lattice whereas
    positive values mean G is a random graph.
    Values close to 0 mean that G has small-world characteristics.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
        An undirected graph.

    niter: integer (optional, default=5)
        Approximate number of rewiring per edge to compute the equivalent
        random graph.

    nrand: integer (optional, default=10)
        Number of random graphs generated to compute the maximal clustering
        coefficient (Cr) and average shortest path length (Lr).

    seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)
        Indicator of random number generation state.

    Returns
    -------
    omega : float
