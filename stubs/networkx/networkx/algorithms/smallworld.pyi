"""
Functions for estimating the small-world-ness of graphs.

A small world network is characterized by a small average shortest path length,
and a large clustering coefficient.

Small-worldness is commonly measured with the coefficient sigma or omega.

Both coefficients compare the average clustering coefficient and shortest path
length of a given graph against the same quantities for an equivalent random
or lattice graph.

For more information, see the Wikipedia article on small-world network [1]_.

    """
    Compute a random graph by swapping edges of a given graph.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
        An undirected graph with 4 or more nodes.

    niter : integer (optional, default=1)
        An edge is rewired approximately `niter` times.

    connectivity : boolean (optional, default=True)
        When True, ensure connectivity for the randomized graph.

    seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)
        Indicator of random number generation state.
        See :ref:`Randomness<randomness>`.

    Returns
    -------
    G : graph
        The randomized graph.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
        If there are fewer than 4 nodes or 2 edges in `G`
