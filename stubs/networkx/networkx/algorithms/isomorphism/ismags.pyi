ISMAGS Algorithm
================

Provides a Python implementation of the ISMAGS algorithm. [1]_

It is capable of finding (subgraph) isomorphisms between two graphs, taking the
symmetry of the subgraph into account. In most cases the VF2 algorithm is
faster (at least on small graphs) than this implementation, but in some cases
there is an exponential number of isomorphisms that are symmetrically
equivalent. In that case, the ISMAGS algorithm will provide only one solution
per symmetry group.

>>> petersen = nx.petersen_graph()
>>> ismags = nx.isomorphism.ISMAGS(petersen, petersen)
>>> isomorphisms = list(ismags.isomorphisms_iter(symmetry=False))
>>> len(isomorphisms)
120
>>> isomorphisms = list(ismags.isomorphisms_iter(symmetry=True))
>>> answer = [{0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3, 4: 4, 5: 5, 6: 6, 7: 7, 8: 8, 9: 9}]
>>> answer == isomorphisms
True

In addition, this implementation also provides an interface to find the
largest common induced subgraph [2]_ between any two graphs, again taking
symmetry into account. Given `graph` and `subgraph` the algorithm will remove
nodes from the `subgraph` until `subgraph` is isomorphic to a subgraph of
`graph`. Since only the symmetry of `subgraph` is taken into account it is
worth thinking about how you provide your graphs:

>>> graph1 = nx.path_graph(4)
>>> graph2 = nx.star_graph(3)
>>> ismags = nx.isomorphism.ISMAGS(graph1, graph2)
>>> ismags.is_isomorphic()
False
>>> largest_common_subgraph = list(ismags.largest_common_subgraph())
>>> answer = [{1: 0, 0: 1, 2: 2}, {2: 0, 1: 1, 3: 2}]
>>> answer == largest_common_subgraph
True
>>> ismags2 = nx.isomorphism.ISMAGS(graph2, graph1)
>>> largest_common_subgraph = list(ismags2.largest_common_subgraph())
>>> answer = [
...     {1: 0, 0: 1, 2: 2},
...     {1: 0, 0: 1, 3: 2},
...     {2: 0, 0: 1, 1: 2},
...     {2: 0, 0: 1, 3: 2},
...     {3: 0, 0: 1, 1: 2},
...     {3: 0, 0: 1, 2: 2},
... ]
>>> answer == largest_common_subgraph
True

However, when not taking symmetry into account, it doesn't matter:

>>> largest_common_subgraph = list(ismags.largest_common_subgraph(symmetry=False))
>>> answer = [
...     {1: 0, 0: 1, 2: 2},
...     {1: 0, 2: 1, 0: 2},
...     {2: 0, 1: 1, 3: 2},
...     {2: 0, 3: 1, 1: 2},
...     {1: 0, 0: 1, 2: 3},
...     {1: 0, 2: 1, 0: 3},
...     {2: 0, 1: 1, 3: 3},
...     {2: 0, 3: 1, 1: 3},
...     {1: 0, 0: 2, 2: 3},
...     {1: 0, 2: 2, 0: 3},
...     {2: 0, 1: 2, 3: 3},
...     {2: 0, 3: 2, 1: 3},
... ]
>>> answer == largest_common_subgraph
True
>>> largest_common_subgraph = list(ismags2.largest_common_subgraph(symmetry=False))
>>> answer = [
...     {1: 0, 0: 1, 2: 2},
...     {1: 0, 0: 1, 3: 2},
...     {2: 0, 0: 1, 1: 2},
...     {2: 0, 0: 1, 3: 2},
...     {3: 0, 0: 1, 1: 2},
...     {3: 0, 0: 1, 2: 2},
...     {1: 1, 0: 2, 2: 3},
...     {1: 1, 0: 2, 3: 3},
...     {2: 1, 0: 2, 1: 3},
...     {2: 1, 0: 2, 3: 3},
...     {3: 1, 0: 2, 1: 3},
...     {3: 1, 0: 2, 2: 3},
... ]
>>> answer == largest_common_subgraph
True

Notes
-----
- The current implementation works for undirected graphs only. The algorithm
  in general should work for directed graphs as well though.
- Node keys for both provided graphs need to be fully orderable as well as
  hashable.
- Node and edge equality is assumed to be transitive: if A is equal to B, and
  B is equal to C, then A is equal to C.

    """
    Implements the ISMAGS subgraph matching algorithm. [1]_ ISMAGS stands for
    "Index-based Subgraph Matching Algorithm with General Symmetries". As the
    name implies, it is symmetry aware and will only generate non-symmetric
    isomorphisms.

    Notes
    -----
    The implementation imposes additional conditions compared to the VF2
    algorithm on the graphs provided and the comparison functions
    (:attr:`node_equality` and :attr:`edge_equality`):

     - Node keys in both graphs must be orderable as well as hashable.
     - Equality must be transitive: if A is equal to B, and B is equal to C,
       then A must be equal to C.
