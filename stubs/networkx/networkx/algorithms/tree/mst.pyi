    Iterate over all spanning trees of a graph in either increasing or
    decreasing cost.

    Notes
    -----
    This iterator uses the partition scheme from [1]_ (included edges,
    excluded edges and open edges) as well as a modified Kruskal's Algorithm
    to generate minimum spanning trees which respect the partition of edges.
    For spanning trees with the same weight, ties are broken arbitrarily.
