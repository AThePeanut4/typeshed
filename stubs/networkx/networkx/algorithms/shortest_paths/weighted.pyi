    Returns the shortest weighted path from source to target in G.

    Uses Dijkstra's Method to compute the shortest weighted path
    between two nodes in a graph.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

    source : node
        Starting node

    target : node
        Ending node

    weight : string or function
        If this is a string, then edge weights will be accessed via the
        edge attribute with this key (that is, the weight of the edge
        joining `u` to `v` will be ``G.edges[u, v][weight]``). If no
        such edge attribute exists, the weight of the edge is assumed to
        be one.

        If this is a function, the weight of an edge is the value
        returned by the function. The function must accept exactly three
        positional arguments: the two endpoints of an edge and the
        dictionary of edge attributes for that edge. The function must
        return a number or None to indicate a hidden edge.

    Returns
    -------
    path : list
        List of nodes in a shortest path.

    Raises
    ------
    NodeNotFound
        If `source` is not in `G`.

    NetworkXNoPath
        If no path exists between source and target.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.path_graph(5)
    >>> print(nx.dijkstra_path(G, 0, 4))
    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

    Find edges of shortest path in Multigraph

    >>> G = nx.MultiDiGraph()
    >>> G.add_weighted_edges_from([(1, 2, 0.75), (1, 2, 0.5), (2, 3, 0.5), (1, 3, 1.5)])
    >>> nodes = nx.dijkstra_path(G, 1, 3)
    >>> edges = nx.utils.pairwise(nodes)
    >>> list(
    ...     (u, v, min(G[u][v], key=lambda k: G[u][v][k].get("weight", 1)))
    ...     for u, v in edges
    ... )
    [(1, 2, 1), (2, 3, 0)]

    Notes
    -----
    Edge weight attributes must be numerical.
    Distances are calculated as sums of weighted edges traversed.

    The weight function can be used to hide edges by returning None.
    So ``weight = lambda u, v, d: 1 if d['color']=="red" else None``
    will find the shortest red path.

    The weight function can be used to include node weights.

    >>> def func(u, v, d):
    ...     node_u_wt = G.nodes[u].get("node_weight", 1)
    ...     node_v_wt = G.nodes[v].get("node_weight", 1)
    ...     edge_wt = d.get("weight", 1)
    ...     return node_u_wt / 2 + node_v_wt / 2 + edge_wt

    In this example we take the average of start and end node
    weights of an edge and add it to the weight of the edge.

    The function :func:`single_source_dijkstra` computes both
    path and length-of-path if you need both, use that.

    Notes
    -----
    Edge weight attributes must be numerical.
    Distances are calculated as sums of weighted edges traversed.

    The weight function can be used to hide edges by returning None.
    So ``weight = lambda u, v, d: 1 if d['color']=="red" else None``
    will find the shortest red path.

    Based on the Python cookbook recipe (119466) at
    https://code.activestate.com/recipes/119466/

    This algorithm is not guaranteed to work if edge weights
    are negative or are floating point numbers
    (overflows and roundoff errors can cause problems).

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `sources` is empty.
    NodeNotFound
        If any of `sources` is not in `G`.

    Compute weighted shortest path length and predecessors.

    Uses Dijkstra's Method to obtain the shortest weighted paths

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

        return a number or None to indicate a hidden edge.

    Returns
    -------
    pred, distance : dictionaries
        Returns two dictionaries representing a list of predecessors
        of a node and the distance to each node.

    Raises

    Yields
    ------
    (node, (distance, path)) : (node obj, (dict, dict))

        (See single_source_dijkstra for the source/target node terminology.)
        If desired you can apply `dict()` to this function to create a dict
        keyed by source node to the two dicts.

        If target is None, returns a tuple of two dictionaries keyed by node.
        The first dictionary stores distance from one of the source nodes.
        The second stores the path from one of the sources to that node.
        If target is not None, returns a tuple of (distance, path) where
        distance is the distance from source to target and path is a list
        representing the path from source to target.

    Raises
    ------
    NodeNotFound
        If `source` is not in `G`.

    Notes
    -----
    Edge weight attributes must be numerical.
    Distances are calculated as sums of weighted edges traversed.

    The weight function can be used to hide edges by returning None.
    So ``weight = lambda u, v, d: 1 if d['color']=="red" else None``
    will find the shortest red path.

    In practice  bidirectional Dijkstra is much more than twice as fast as
    ordinary Dijkstra.

    Ordinary Dijkstra expands nodes in a sphere-like manner from the
    source. The radius of this sphere will eventually be the length
    of the shortest path. Bidirectional Dijkstra will expand nodes
    from both the source and the target, making two spheres of half
    this radius. Volume of the first sphere is `\pi*r*r` while the
    others are `2*\pi*r/2*r/2`, making up half the volume.

    This algorithm is not guaranteed to work if edge weights
    are negative or are floating point numbers
    (overflows and roundoff errors can cause problems).

    Returns

    Notes
    -----
    Johnson's algorithm is suitable even for graphs with negative weights. It
    works by using the Bellman–Ford algorithm to compute a transformation of
    the input graph that removes all negative weights, allowing Dijkstra's
    algorithm to be used on the transformed graph.

    The time complexity of this algorithm is $O(n^2 \log n + n m)$,
    where $n$ is the number of nodes and $m$ the number of edges in the
    graph. For dense graphs, this may be faster than the Floyd–Warshall
    algorithm.
