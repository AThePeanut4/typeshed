def equitable_color(G: Graph[_Node], num_colors):
    """
    Provides an equitable coloring for nodes of `G`.

    Attempts to color a graph using `num_colors` colors, where no neighbors of
    a node can have same color as the node itself and the number of nodes with
    each color differ by at most 1. `num_colors` must be greater than the
    maximum degree of `G`. The algorithm is described in [1]_ and has
    complexity O(num_colors * n**2).

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : networkX graph
       The nodes of this graph will be colored.

    num_colors : number of colors to use
       This number must be at least one more than the maximum degree of nodes
       in the graph.

    Returns
    -------
    A dictionary with keys representing nodes and values representing
    corresponding coloring.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.cycle_graph(4)
    >>> nx.coloring.equitable_color(G, num_colors=3)  # doctest: +SKIP
    {0: 2, 1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 0}

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXAlgorithmError
        If `num_colors` is not at least the maximum degree of the graph `G`
