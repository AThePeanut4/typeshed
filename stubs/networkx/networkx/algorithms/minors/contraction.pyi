def equivalence_classes(iterable, relation):
    """
    Returns equivalence classes of `relation` when applied to `iterable`.

    The equivalence classes, or blocks, consist of objects from `iterable`
    which are all equivalent. They are defined to be equivalent if the
    `relation` function returns `True` when passed any two objects from that
    class, and `False` otherwise. To define an equivalence relation the
    function must be reflexive, symmetric and transitive.

    Parameters
    ----------
    iterable : list, tuple, or set
        An iterable of elements/nodes.

    relation : function
        A Boolean-valued function that implements an equivalence relation
        (reflexive, symmetric, transitive binary relation) on the elements
        of `iterable` - it must take two elements and return `True` if
        they are related, or `False` if not.

    Returns
    -------
    set of frozensets
        A set of frozensets representing the partition induced by the equivalence
        relation function `relation` on the elements of `iterable`. Each
        member set in the return set represents an equivalence class, or
        block, of the partition.

        Duplicate elements will be ignored so it makes the most sense for
        `iterable` to be a :class:`set`.

    Notes
    -----
    This function does not check that `relation` represents an equivalence
    relation. You can check that your equivalence classes provide a partition
    using `is_partition`.

    Examples
    --------
    Let `X` be the set of integers from `0` to `9`, and consider an equivalence
    relation `R` on `X` of congruence modulo `3`: this means that two integers
    `x` and `y` in `X` are equivalent under `R` if they leave the same
    remainder when divided by `3`, i.e. `(x - y) mod 3 = 0`.

    The equivalence classes of this relation are `{0, 3, 6, 9}`, `{1, 4, 7}`,
    `{2, 5, 8}`: `0`, `3`, `6`, `9` are all divisible by `3` and leave zero
    remainder; `1`, `4`, `7` leave remainder `1`; while `2`, `5` and `8` leave
    remainder `2`. We can see this by calling `equivalence_classes` with
    `X` and a function implementation of `R`.

    >>> X = set(range(10))
    >>> def mod3(x, y):
    ...     return (x - y) % 3 == 0
    >>> equivalence_classes(X, mod3)  # doctest: +SKIP
    {frozenset({1, 4, 7}), frozenset({8, 2, 5}), frozenset({0, 9, 3, 6})}
