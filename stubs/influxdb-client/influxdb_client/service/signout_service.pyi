        Expire a user session.

        Expires a user session specified by a session cookie.  Use this endpoint to expire a user session that was generated when the user authenticated with the InfluxDB Developer Console (UI) or the `POST /api/v2/signin` endpoint.  For example, the `POST /api/v2/signout` endpoint represents the third step in the following three-step process to authenticate a user, retrieve the `user` resource, and then expire the session:  1. Send a request with the user's [Basic authentication credentials](#section/Authentication/BasicAuthentication)    to the `POST /api/v2/signin` endpoint to create a user session and    generate a session cookie. 2. Send a request to the `GET /api/v2/me` endpoint, passing the stored session cookie    from step 1 to retrieve user information. 3. Send a request to the `POST /api/v2/signout` endpoint, passing the stored session    cookie to expire the session.  _See the complete example in request samples._  InfluxDB stores user sessions in memory only. If a user doesn't sign out, then the user session automatically expires within ten minutes or during a restart of the InfluxDB instance.
