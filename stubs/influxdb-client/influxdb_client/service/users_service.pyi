        Create a user.

        Creates a [user](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/latest/reference/glossary/#user) that can access InfluxDB. Returns the user.  Use this endpoint to create a user that can sign in to start a user session through one of the following interfaces:    - InfluxDB UI   - `/api/v2/signin` InfluxDB API endpoint   - InfluxDB CLI  This endpoint represents the first two steps in a four-step process to allow a user to authenticate with a username and password, and then access data in an organization:    1. Create a user: send a `POST` request to `POST /api/v2/users`. The `name` property is required.   2. Extract the user ID (`id` property) value from the API response for _step 1_.   3. Create an authorization (and API token) for the user: send a `POST` request to [`POST /api/v2/authorizations`](#operation/PostAuthorizations), passing the user ID (`id`) from _step 2_.   4. Create a password for the user: send a `POST` request to [`POST /api/v2/users/USER_ID/password`](#operation/PostUsersIDPassword), passing the user ID from _step 2_.  #### Required permissions  | Action | Permission required | Restriction | |:-------|:--------------------|:------------| | Create a user | _[Operator token](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/latest/security/tokens/#operator-token)_  | |  #### Related guides  - [Create a user](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/latest/users/create-user/) - [Create an API token scoped to a user](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/latest/security/tokens/create-token/#create-a-token-scoped-to-a-user)
