        Create a new JACK client.

        A client object is a *context manager*, i.e. it can be used in a

        beginning of the statement and `deactivate()` and `close()` on
        exit.

        Parameters
        ----------
        name : str
            The desired client name of at most `client_name_size()`
            characters.  The name scope is local to each server.
            Unless forbidden by the *use_exact_name* option, the server
            will modify this name to create a unique variant, if needed.

        Other Parameters
        ----------------
        use_exact_name : bool
            Whether an error should be raised if *name* is not unique.
            See `Status.name_not_unique`.
        no_start_server : bool

            environment.
        servername : str
            Selects from among several possible concurrent server
            instances.
            Server names are unique to each user.  If unspecified, use
            ``'default'`` unless ``JACK_DEFAULT_SERVER`` is defined in
            the process environment.
        session_id : str
            Pass a SessionID Token. This allows the sessionmanager to
            identify the client again.

        Raises
        ------

        As a result, freewheel mode causes "faster than realtime"
        execution of a JACK graph. If possessed, real-time scheduling is

        reacquired when stopping.

            .. note:: The *callback* should typically signal another
               thread to correctly finish cleanup by calling `close()`
               (since it cannot be called directly in the context of the
               thread that calls the shutdown callback).

               After server shutdown, the client is *not* deallocated by
               JACK, the user (that's you!) is responsible to properly
               use `close()` to release client ressources.
               Alternatively, the `Client` object can be used as a
               *context manager* in a *with statement*, which takes care
               of activating, deactivating and closing the client
               automatically.

        Tell the JACK server to call *callback* whenever there is work

        The code in the supplied function must be suitable for real-time
        execution.  That means that it cannot call functions that might
        block for a long time. This includes malloc, free, printf,

        pthread_cond_wait, etc, etc.

        .. warning:: Most Python interpreters use a `global interpreter
           lock (GIL)`__, which violates the above real-time
           requirement.  Furthermore, Python's `garbage collector`__
           might become active at an inconvenient time and block the
           process callback for some time.

           Because of this, Python is not really suitable for real-time
           processing.  If you want to implement a *reliable* real-time
           audio/MIDI application, you should use a different
           programming language, such as C or C++.

           If you can live with some random audio drop-outs now and
           then, feel free to continue using Python!

        Parameters
        ----------
        callback : callable

            there is work to be done.  It must have this signature::

                callback(frames: int) -> None

            The argument *frames* specifies the number of frames that
            have to be processed in the current audio block.
            It will be the same number as `blocksize` and it will be a
            power of two.

            As long as the client is active, the *callback* will be
            called once in each process cycle.  However, if an exception
            is raised inside of a *callback*, it will not be called
            anymore.  The exception `CallbackExit` can be used to
            silently prevent further callback invocations, all other
            exceptions will print an error message to *stderr*.

        Register (or unregister) as a slow-sync client.

        A slow-sync client is one that cannot respond immediately to
        transport position changes.

        The *callback* will be invoked at the first available
        opportunity after its registration is complete.  If the client
        is currently active this will be the following process cycle,
        otherwise it will be the first cycle after calling `activate()`.
        After that, it runs whenever some client requests a new

        Clients that don't set a *sync callback* are assumed to be ready
        immediately any time the transport wants to start.

        Parameters
        ----------
        callback : callable or None

            User-supplied function that returns ``True`` when the

            - `STARTING` when the transport is waiting to start;
            - `ROLLING` when the timeout has expired, and the position
              is now a moving target.

            The *pos* argument holds the new transport position using
            the same structure as returned by
            `transport_query_struct()`.

            Setting *callback* to ``None`` declares that this
            client no longer requires slow-sync processing.

            transport is rolling, or when any client has requested a new
            position in the previous cycle.  The first cycle after
            `set_timebase_callback()` is also treated as a new position,
            or the first cycle after `activate()` if the client had been
            inactive.  The *callback* must have this signature::

                callback(
                    state: int,
                    blocksize: int,
                    pos: jack_position_t,
                    new_pos: bool,
                ) -> None

            state
                The current transport state.  See `transport_state`.
            blocksize
                The number of frames in the current period.
                See `blocksize`.
            pos
                The position structure for the next cycle; ``pos.frame``
                will be its frame number.  If *new_pos* is ``False``,
                this structure contains extended position information
                from the current cycle.  If *new_pos* is ``True``, it
                contains whatever was set by the requester.
                The *callback*'s task is to update the extended
                information here.  See `transport_query_struct()`
                for details about ``jack_position_t``.
            new_pos
                ``True`` for a newly requested *pos*, or for the first
                cycle after the timebase callback is defined.

            .. note:: The *pos* argument must not be used to set
               ``pos.frame``.  To change position, use
               `transport_reposition_struct()` or `transport_locate()`.
               These functions are realtime-safe, the timebase callback
               can call them directly.
        conditional : bool
            Set to ``True`` for a conditional request.

        Returns
        -------
        bool
            ``True`` if the timebase callback was registered.
            ``False`` if a conditional request failed because another
            timebase master is already registered.

    def __init__(self, size: int) -> None:
        """
        Create a lock-free ringbuffer.

        A ringbuffer is a good way to pass data between threads
        (e.g. between the main program and the process callback),
        when streaming realtime data to slower media, like audio file
        playback or recording.

        The key attribute of a ringbuffer is that it can be safely
        accessed by two threads simultaneously -- one reading from the
        buffer and the other writing to it -- without using any
        synchronization or mutual exclusion primitives.  For this to
        work correctly, there can only be a single reader and a single
        writer thread.  Their identities cannot be interchanged.

        Parameters
        ----------
        size : int
            Size in bytes.  JACK will allocate a buffer of at least this
            size (rounded up to the next power of 2), but one byte is
            reserved for internal use.  Use `write_space` to
            determine the actual size available for writing.
