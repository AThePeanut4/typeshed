class CurveFitting:
    """
    Class CurveFitting deals with finding the function (linear, cuadratic, etc)
    that best fit a given set of points.

    The constructor takes pairs of (x, y) values from the table of interest.
    These pairs of values can be given as a sequence of int/floats, tuples,
    lists or Angles. It is also possible to provide a CurveFitting object to
    the constructor in order to get a copy.

    .. note:: When using Angles, be careful with the 360-to-0 discontinuity.

    If a sequence of int, floats or Angles is given, the values in the odd
    positions are considered to belong to the 'x' set, while the values in the
    even positions belong to the 'y' set. If only one tuple or list is
    provided, it is assumed that it is the 'y' set, and the 'x' set is build
    from 0 onwards with steps of length 1.

    Please keep in mind that a minimum of two data pairs are needed in order to
    carry out any fitting. If only one value pair is provided, a ValueError
    exception will be raised.
