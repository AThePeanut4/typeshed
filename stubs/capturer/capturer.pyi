        descriptor (a simple one-liner).

        If however the file descriptor of the file-like object doesn't have the

        created instead: One of the stream objects will be connected to the

        will be connected to the file descriptor that was expected
        (``expected_fd``).

        This approach is intended to make sure that "nested" output capturing
        works as expected: Output from the current Python process is captured
        from the file descriptor of the file-like object while output from
        subprocesses is captured from the file descriptor given by
        ``expected_fd`` (because the operating system defines special semantics

        just ignore).
