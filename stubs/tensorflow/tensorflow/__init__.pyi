"""
Top-level module of TensorFlow. By convention, we refer to this module as
`tf` instead of `tensorflow`, following the common practice of importing
TensorFlow via the command `import tensorflow as tf`.

The primary function of this module is to import all of the public TensorFlow
interfaces into a single place. The interfaces themselves are located in
sub-modules, as described below.

Note that the file `__init__.py` in the TensorFlow source code tree is actually
only a placeholder to enable test cases to run. The TensorFlow build replaces
this file with a file generated from [`api_template.__init__.py`](https://www.github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/api_template.__init__.py)

class Tensor:
    """
    A `tf.Tensor` represents a multidimensional array of elements.

    All elements are of a single known data type.

    When writing a TensorFlow program, the main object that is
    manipulated and passed around is the `tf.Tensor`.

    A `tf.Tensor` has the following properties:

    * a single data type (float32, int32, or string, for example)
    * a shape

    TensorFlow supports eager execution and graph execution.  In eager
    execution, operations are evaluated immediately.  In graph
    execution, a computational graph is constructed for later
    evaluation.

    TensorFlow defaults to eager execution.  In the example below, the
    matrix multiplication results are calculated immediately.

    >>> # Compute some values using a Tensor
    >>> c = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]])
    >>> d = tf.constant([[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0]])
    >>> e = tf.matmul(c, d)
    >>> print(e)
    tf.Tensor(
    [[1. 3.]
     [3. 7.]], shape=(2, 2), dtype=float32)

    Note that during eager execution, you may discover your `Tensors` are actually
    of type `EagerTensor`.  This is an internal detail, but it does give you
    access to a useful function, `numpy`:

    >>> type(e)
    <class '...ops.EagerTensor'>
    >>> print(e.numpy())
      [[1. 3.]
       [3. 7.]]

    In TensorFlow, `tf.function`s are a common way to define graph execution.

    A Tensor's shape (that is, the rank of the Tensor and the size of
    each dimension) may not always be fully known.  In `tf.function`
    definitions, the shape may only be partially known.

    Most operations produce tensors of fully-known shapes if the shapes of their
    inputs are also fully known, but in some cases it's only possible to find the
    shape of a tensor at execution time.

    A number of specialized tensors are available: see `tf.Variable`,
    `tf.constant`, `tf.placeholder`, `tf.sparse.SparseTensor`, and
    `tf.RaggedTensor`.

    Caution: when constructing a tensor from a numpy array or pandas dataframe
    the underlying buffer may be re-used:

    ```python
    a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
    b = tf.constant(a)
    a[0] = 4
    print(b)  # tf.Tensor([4 2 3], shape=(3,), dtype=int64)
    ```

    Note: this is an implementation detail that is subject to change and users
    should not rely on this behaviour.

    For more on Tensors, see the [guide](https://tensorflow.org/guide/tensor).

        `tf.Tensor.shape` is equivalent to `tf.Tensor.get_shape()`.

        In a `tf.function` or when building a model using
        `tf.keras.Input`, they return the build-time shape of the
        tensor, which may be partially unknown.

        A `tf.TensorShape` is not a tensor. Use `tf.shape(t)` to get a tensor
        containing the shape, calculated at runtime.

        See `tf.Tensor.get_shape()`, and `tf.TensorShape` for details and examples.

        >>> print(a.shape)
        (2, 3)

        `tf.Tensor.get_shape()` is equivalent to `tf.Tensor.shape`.


        When executing in a `tf.function` or building a model using
        `tf.keras.Input`, `Tensor.shape` may return a partial shape (including
        `None` for unknown dimensions). See `tf.TensorShape` for more details.

        >>> inputs = tf.keras.Input(shape = [10])
        >>> # Unknown batch size
        >>> print(inputs.shape)
        (None, 10)

        The shape is computed using shape inference functions that are
        registered for each `tf.Operation`.

        The returned `tf.TensorShape` is determined at *build* time, without
        executing the underlying kernel. It is not a `tf.Tensor`. If you need a
        shape *tensor*, either convert the `tf.TensorShape` to a `tf.constant`, or
        use the `tf.shape(tensor)` function, which returns the tensor's shape at
        *execution* time.

        This is useful for debugging and providing early errors. For
        example, when tracing a `tf.function`, no ops are being executed, shapes
        may be unknown (See the [Concrete Functions
        Guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/concrete_function) for details).

        >>> @tf.function
        ... def my_matmul(a, b):
        ...   result = a@b
        ...   # the `print` executes during tracing.
        ...   print("Result shape: ", result.shape)
        ...   return result

        The shape inference functions propagate shapes to the extent possible:

        >>> f = my_matmul.get_concrete_function(
        ...   tf.TensorSpec([None,3]),
        ...   tf.TensorSpec([3,5]))
        Result shape: (None, 5)

        Tracing may fail if a shape missmatch can be detected:

        >>> cf = my_matmul.get_concrete_function(
        ...   tf.TensorSpec([None,3]),
        ...   tf.TensorSpec([4,5]))
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        ValueError: Dimensions must be equal, but are 3 and 4 for 'matmul' (op:
        'MatMul') with input shapes: [?,3], [4,5].

        In some cases, the inferred shape may have unknown dimensions. If
        the caller has additional information about the values of these
        dimensions, `tf.ensure_shape` or `Tensor.set_shape()` can be used to augment
        the inferred shape.

        >>> @tf.function
        ... def my_fun(a):
        ...   a = tf.ensure_shape(a, [5, 5])

    Indicates how a distributed variable will be aggregated.

    `tf.distribute.Strategy` distributes a model by making multiple copies
    (called "replicas") acting on different elements of the input batch in a
    data parallel model. When performing some variable-update operation,
    for example `var.assign_add(x)`, in a model, we need to resolve how to combine
    the different values for `x` computed in the different replicas.

    * `NONE`: This is the default, giving an error if you use a
      variable-update operation with multiple replicas.
    * `SUM`: Add the updates across replicas.
    * `MEAN`: Take the arithmetic mean ("average") of the updates across replicas.
    * `ONLY_FIRST_REPLICA`: This is for when every replica is performing the same
      update, but we only want to perform the update once. Used, e.g., for the

class Variable(Tensor, metaclass=_VariableMetaclass):

    See the [variable guide](https://tensorflow.org/guide/variable).

    A variable maintains shared, persistent state manipulated by a program.

    The `Variable()` constructor requires an initial value for the variable, which
    can be a `Tensor` of any type and shape. This initial value defines the type
    and shape of the variable. After construction, the type and shape of the
    variable are fixed. The value can be changed using one of the assign methods.

    >>> v = tf.Variable(1.)
    >>> v.assign(2.)
    <tf.Variable ... shape=() dtype=float32, numpy=2.0>
    >>> v.assign_add(0.5)
    <tf.Variable ... shape=() dtype=float32, numpy=2.5>

    The `shape` argument to `Variable`'s constructor allows you to construct a
    variable with a less defined shape than its `initial_value`:

    >>> v = tf.Variable(1., shape=tf.TensorShape(None))
    >>> v.assign([[1.]])
    <tf.Variable ... shape=<unknown> dtype=float32, numpy=array([[1.]], ...)>

    Just like any `Tensor`, variables created with `Variable()` can be used as
    inputs to operations. Additionally, all the operators overloaded for the
    `Tensor` class are carried over to variables.

    >>> w = tf.Variable([[1.], [2.]])
    >>> x = tf.constant([[3., 4.]])
    >>> tf.matmul(w, x)
    <tf.Tensor:... shape=(2, 2), ... numpy=
      array([[3., 4.],
             [6., 8.]], dtype=float32)>
    >>> tf.sigmoid(w + x)
    <tf.Tensor:... shape=(2, 2), ...>

    When building a machine learning model it is often convenient to distinguish
    between variables holding trainable model parameters and other variables such
    as a `step` variable used to count training steps. To make this easier, the
    variable constructor supports a `trainable=<bool>`
    parameter. `tf.GradientTape` watches trainable variables by default:

    >>> with tf.GradientTape(persistent=True) as tape:
    ...   trainable = tf.Variable(1.)
    ...   non_trainable = tf.Variable(2., trainable=False)
    ...   x1 = trainable * 2.
    ...   x2 = non_trainable * 3.
    >>> tape.gradient(x1, trainable)
    <tf.Tensor:... shape=(), dtype=float32, numpy=2.0>
    >>> assert tape.gradient(x2, non_trainable) is None  # Unwatched

    Variables are automatically tracked when assigned to attributes of types
    inheriting from `tf.Module`.

    >>> m = tf.Module()
    >>> m.v = tf.Variable([1.])
    >>> m.trainable_variables
    (<tf.Variable ... shape=(1,) ... numpy=array([1.], dtype=float32)>,)

    This tracking then allows saving variable values to
    [training checkpoints](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/checkpoint), or to
    [SavedModels](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/saved_model) which include
    serialized TensorFlow graphs.

    Variables are often captured and manipulated by `tf.function`s. This works the
    same way the un-decorated function would have:

    >>> v = tf.Variable(0.)
    >>> read_and_decrement = tf.function(lambda: v.assign_sub(0.1))
    >>> read_and_decrement()
    <tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=float32, numpy=-0.1>
    >>> read_and_decrement()
    <tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=float32, numpy=-0.2>

    Variables created inside a `tf.function` must be owned outside the function
    and be created only once:

    >>> class M(tf.Module):
    ...   @tf.function
    ...   def __call__(self, x):
    ...     if not hasattr(self, "v"):  # Or set self.v to None in __init__
    ...       self.v = tf.Variable(x)
    ...     return self.v * x
    >>> m = M()
    >>> m(2.)
    <tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=float32, numpy=4.0>
    >>> m(3.)
    <tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=float32, numpy=6.0>
    >>> m.v
    <tf.Variable ... shape=() dtype=float32, numpy=2.0>

    See the `tf.function` documentation for details.

        Creates a new variable with value `initial_value`. (deprecated arguments)

        Deprecated: SOME ARGUMENTS ARE DEPRECATED: `(caching_device)`. They will be removed in a future version.
        Instructions for updating:
        A variable's value can be manually cached by calling tf.Variable.read_value() under a tf.device scope. The caching_device argument does not work properly.

        Args:
          initial_value: A `Tensor`, or Python object convertible to a `Tensor`,
            which is the initial value for the Variable. The initial value must have
            a shape specified unless `validate_shape` is set to False. Can also be a
            callable with no argument that returns the initial value when called. In
            that case, `dtype` must be specified. (Note that initializer functions
            from init_ops.py must first be bound to a shape before being used here.)
          trainable: If `True`, GradientTapes automatically watch uses of this
            variable. Defaults to `True`, unless `synchronization` is set to
            `ON_READ`, in which case it defaults to `False`.
          validate_shape: If `False`, allows the variable to be initialized with a
            value of unknown shape. If `True`, the default, the shape of
            `initial_value` must be known.
          caching_device: Note: This argument is only valid when using a v1-style
            `Session`. Optional device string describing where the Variable should
            be cached for reading. Defaults to the Variable's device. If not `None`,
            caches on another device. Typical use is to cache on the device where
            the Ops using the Variable reside, to deduplicate copying through
            `Switch` and other conditional statements.
          name: Optional name for the variable. Defaults to `'Variable'` and gets
            uniquified automatically.
          variable_def: `VariableDef` protocol buffer. If not `None`, recreates the
            Variable object with its contents, referencing the variable's nodes in
            the graph, which must already exist. The graph is not changed.
            `variable_def` and the other arguments are mutually exclusive.
          dtype: If set, initial_value will be converted to the given type. If
            `None`, either the datatype will be kept (if `initial_value` is a
            Tensor), or `convert_to_tensor` will decide.
          import_scope: Optional `string`. Name scope to add to the `Variable.` Only
            used when initializing from protocol buffer.
          constraint: An optional projection function to be applied to the variable
            after being updated by an `Optimizer` (e.g. used to implement norm
            constraints or value constraints for layer weights). The function must
            take as input the unprojected Tensor representing the value of the
            variable and return the Tensor for the projected value (which must have
            the same shape). Constraints are not safe to use when doing asynchronous
            distributed training.
          synchronization: Indicates when a distributed variable will be
            aggregated. Accepted values are constants defined in the class
            `tf.VariableSynchronization`. By default the synchronization is set to
            `AUTO` and the current `DistributionStrategy` chooses when to
            synchronize.
          aggregation: Indicates how a distributed variable will be aggregated.
            Accepted values are constants defined in the class
            `tf.VariableAggregation`.
          shape: (optional) The shape of this variable. If None, the shape of
            `initial_value` will be used. When setting this argument to
            `tf.TensorShape(None)` (representing an unspecified shape), the variable
            can be assigned with values of different shapes.
          experimental_enable_variable_lifting: Whether to lift the variable out if
            it's in a `tf.function`. Default is `True`. When this argument
            is `True`, variable creation will follow the behavior and
            restrictions described
            [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/function#creating_tfvariables).
            If this argument is `False`, that description doesn't apply,
            and you can freely create and use the variable in the
            `tf.function`, as if it's a "mutable `tf.Tensor`". You can't
            return the variable though.

        Raises:
          ValueError: If both `variable_def` and initial_value are specified.
          ValueError: If the initial value is not specified, or does not have a
            shape and `validate_shape` is `True`.

class RaggedTensor(metaclass=ABCMeta):
    """
    Represents a ragged tensor.

    A `RaggedTensor` is a tensor with one or more *ragged dimensions*, which are
    dimensions whose slices may have different lengths.  For example, the inner
    (column) dimension of `rt=[[3, 1, 4, 1], [], [5, 9, 2], [6], []]` is ragged,
    since the column slices (`rt[0, :]`, ..., `rt[4, :]`) have different lengths.
    Dimensions whose slices all have the same length are called *uniform
    dimensions*.  The outermost dimension of a `RaggedTensor` is always uniform,
    since it consists of a single slice (and so there is no possibility for
    differing slice lengths).

    The total number of dimensions in a `RaggedTensor` is called its *rank*,
    and the number of ragged dimensions in a `RaggedTensor` is called its
    *ragged-rank*.  A `RaggedTensor`'s ragged-rank is fixed at graph creation
    time: it can't depend on the runtime values of `Tensor`s, and can't vary
    dynamically for different session runs.

    Note that the `__init__` constructor is private. Please use one of the
    following methods to construct a `RaggedTensor`:

    * `tf.RaggedTensor.from_row_lengths`
    * `tf.RaggedTensor.from_value_rowids`
    * `tf.RaggedTensor.from_row_splits`
    * `tf.RaggedTensor.from_row_starts`
    * `tf.RaggedTensor.from_row_limits`
    * `tf.RaggedTensor.from_nested_row_splits`
    * `tf.RaggedTensor.from_nested_row_lengths`
    * `tf.RaggedTensor.from_nested_value_rowids`

    ### Potentially Ragged Tensors

    Many ops support both `Tensor`s and `RaggedTensor`s
    (see [tf.ragged](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/ragged) for a
    full listing). The term "potentially ragged tensor" may be used to refer to a
    tensor that might be either a `Tensor` or a `RaggedTensor`.  The ragged-rank
    of a `Tensor` is zero.

    ### Documenting RaggedTensor Shapes

    When documenting the shape of a RaggedTensor, ragged dimensions can be
    indicated by enclosing them in parentheses.  For example, the shape of
    a 3-D `RaggedTensor` that stores the fixed-size word embedding for each
    word in a sentence, for each sentence in a batch, could be written as
    `[num_sentences, (num_words), embedding_size]`.  The parentheses around
    `(num_words)` indicate that dimension is ragged, and that the length
    of each element list in that dimension may vary for each item.

    ### Component Tensors

    Internally, a `RaggedTensor` consists of a concatenated list of values that
    are partitioned into variable-length rows.  In particular, each `RaggedTensor`
    consists of:

      * A `values` tensor, which concatenates the variable-length rows into a
        flattened list.  For example, the `values` tensor for
        `[[3, 1, 4, 1], [], [5, 9, 2], [6], []]` is `[3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6]`.

      * A `row_splits` vector, which indicates how those flattened values are
        divided into rows.  In particular, the values for row `rt[i]` are stored
        in the slice `rt.values[rt.row_splits[i]:rt.row_splits[i+1]]`.

    Example:

    >>> print(tf.RaggedTensor.from_row_splits(
    ...       values=[3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6],
    ...       row_splits=[0, 4, 4, 7, 8, 8]))
    <tf.RaggedTensor [[3, 1, 4, 1], [], [5, 9, 2], [6], []]>

    ### Alternative Row-Partitioning Schemes

    In addition to `row_splits`, ragged tensors provide support for five other
    row-partitioning schemes:

      * `row_lengths`: a vector with shape `[nrows]`, which specifies the length
        of each row.

      * `value_rowids` and `nrows`: `value_rowids` is a vector with shape
        `[nvals]`, corresponding one-to-one with `values`, which specifies
        each value's row index.  In particular, the row `rt[row]` consists of the
        values `rt.values[j]` where `value_rowids[j]==row`.  `nrows` is an
        integer scalar that specifies the number of rows in the
        `RaggedTensor`. (`nrows` is used to indicate trailing empty rows.)

      * `row_starts`: a vector with shape `[nrows]`, which specifies the start
        offset of each row.  Equivalent to `row_splits[:-1]`.

      * `row_limits`: a vector with shape `[nrows]`, which specifies the stop
        offset of each row.  Equivalent to `row_splits[1:]`.

      * `uniform_row_length`: A scalar tensor, specifying the length of every
        row.  This row-partitioning scheme may only be used if all rows have
        the same length.

    Example: The following ragged tensors are equivalent, and all represent the
    nested list `[[3, 1, 4, 1], [], [5, 9, 2], [6], []]`.

    >>> values = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6]
    >>> RaggedTensor.from_row_splits(values, row_splits=[0, 4, 4, 7, 8, 8])
    <tf.RaggedTensor [[3, 1, 4, 1], [], [5, 9, 2], [6], []]>
    >>> RaggedTensor.from_row_lengths(values, row_lengths=[4, 0, 3, 1, 0])
    <tf.RaggedTensor [[3, 1, 4, 1], [], [5, 9, 2], [6], []]>
    >>> RaggedTensor.from_value_rowids(
    ...     values, value_rowids=[0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 3], nrows=5)
    <tf.RaggedTensor [[3, 1, 4, 1], [], [5, 9, 2], [6], []]>
    >>> RaggedTensor.from_row_starts(values, row_starts=[0, 4, 4, 7, 8])
    <tf.RaggedTensor [[3, 1, 4, 1], [], [5, 9, 2], [6], []]>
    >>> RaggedTensor.from_row_limits(values, row_limits=[4, 4, 7, 8, 8])
    <tf.RaggedTensor [[3, 1, 4, 1], [], [5, 9, 2], [6], []]>
    >>> RaggedTensor.from_uniform_row_length(values, uniform_row_length=2)
    <tf.RaggedTensor [[3, 1], [4, 1], [5, 9], [2, 6]]>

    ### Multiple Ragged Dimensions

    `RaggedTensor`s with multiple ragged dimensions can be defined by using
    a nested `RaggedTensor` for the `values` tensor.  Each nested `RaggedTensor`
    adds a single ragged dimension.

    >>> inner_rt = RaggedTensor.from_row_splits(  # =rt1 from above
    ...     values=[3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6], row_splits=[0, 4, 4, 7, 8, 8])
    >>> outer_rt = RaggedTensor.from_row_splits(
    ...     values=inner_rt, row_splits=[0, 3, 3, 5])
    >>> print(outer_rt.to_list())
    [[[3, 1, 4, 1], [], [5, 9, 2]], [], [[6], []]]
    >>> print(outer_rt.ragged_rank)
    2

    The factory function `RaggedTensor.from_nested_row_splits` may be used to
    construct a `RaggedTensor` with multiple ragged dimensions directly, by
    providing a list of `row_splits` tensors:

    >>> RaggedTensor.from_nested_row_splits(
    ...     flat_values=[3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6],
    ...     nested_row_splits=([0, 3, 3, 5], [0, 4, 4, 7, 8, 8])).to_list()
    [[[3, 1, 4, 1], [], [5, 9, 2]], [], [[6], []]]

    ### Uniform Inner Dimensions

    `RaggedTensor`s with uniform inner dimensions can be defined
    by using a multidimensional `Tensor` for `values`.

    >>> rt = RaggedTensor.from_row_splits(values=tf.ones([5, 3], tf.int32),
    ...                                   row_splits=[0, 2, 5])
    >>> print(rt.to_list())
    [[[1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1]],
     [[1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1]]]
    >>> print(rt.shape)
    (2, None, 3)

    ### Uniform Outer Dimensions

    `RaggedTensor`s with uniform outer dimensions can be defined by using
    one or more `RaggedTensor` with a `uniform_row_length` row-partitioning
    tensor.  For example, a `RaggedTensor` with shape `[2, 2, None]` can be
    constructed with this method from a `RaggedTensor` values with shape
    `[4, None]`:

    >>> values = tf.ragged.constant([[1, 2, 3], [4], [5, 6], [7, 8, 9, 10]])
    >>> print(values.shape)
    (4, None)
    >>> rt6 = tf.RaggedTensor.from_uniform_row_length(values, 2)
    >>> print(rt6)
    <tf.RaggedTensor [[[1, 2, 3], [4]], [[5, 6], [7, 8, 9, 10]]]>
    >>> print(rt6.shape)
    (2, 2, None)

    Note that `rt6` only contains one ragged dimension (the innermost
    dimension). In contrast, if `from_row_splits` is used to construct a similar
    `RaggedTensor`, then that `RaggedTensor` will have two ragged dimensions:

    >>> rt7 = tf.RaggedTensor.from_row_splits(values, [0, 2, 4])
    >>> print(rt7.shape)
    (2, None, None)

    Uniform and ragged outer dimensions may be interleaved, meaning that a
    tensor with any combination of ragged and uniform dimensions may be created.
    For example, a RaggedTensor `t4` with shape `[3, None, 4, 8, None, 2]` could
    be constructed as follows:

    ```python
    t0 = tf.zeros([1000, 2])                           # Shape:         [1000, 2]
    t1 = RaggedTensor.from_row_lengths(t0, [...])      #           [160, None, 2]
    t2 = RaggedTensor.from_uniform_row_length(t1, 8)   #         [20, 8, None, 2]
    t3 = RaggedTensor.from_uniform_row_length(t2, 4)   #       [5, 4, 8, None, 2]
    t4 = RaggedTensor.from_row_lengths(t3, [...])      # [3, None, 4, 8, None, 2]
    ```

    """
    Represents the shape of a `Tensor`.

    >>> t = tf.constant([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]])
    >>> t.shape
    TensorShape([2, 3])

    `TensorShape` is the *static* shape representation of a Tensor.
    During eager execution a Tensor always has a fully specified shape but
    when tracing a `tf.function` it may be one of the following:

    * *Fully-known shape:* has a known number of dimensions and a known size
      for each dimension. e.g. `TensorShape([16, 256])`
    * *Partially-known shape:* has a known number of dimensions, and an unknown
      size for one or more dimension. e.g. `TensorShape([None, 256])`
    * *Unknown shape:* has an unknown number of dimensions, and an unknown
      size in all dimensions. e.g. `TensorShape(None)`

    During function tracing `t.shape` will return a `TensorShape` object
    representing the shape of Tensor as it is known during tracing.
    This static representation will be partially defined in cases where the
    exact shape depends on the values within the tensors. To get the
    *dynamic* representation, please use `tf.shape(t)`
    which will return Tensor representing the fully defined shape of `t`.
    This way, you can express logic that manipulates the shapes of tensors by
    building other tensors that depend on the dynamic shape of `t`.

    Note: `tf.RaggedTensor.shape` also returns a `tf.TensorShape`,
    the lengths of any ragged dimensions are unknown (`None`).

    For example, this function prints the `TensorShape' (`t.shape`), when you
    trace the function, and returns a tensor `tf.shape(t)` for given input `t`:

    >>> @tf.function
    ... def get_dynamic_shape(t):
    ...   print("tracing...")
    ...   print(f"static shape is {t.shape}")
    ...   return tf.shape(t)

    Just calling the function traces it with a fully-specified static shape:

    >>> result = get_dynamic_shape(tf.constant([[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0]]))
    tracing...
    static shape is (2, 3)
    >>> result.numpy()
    array([2, 3], dtype=int32)

    But `tf.function` can also trace the function with a partially specified
    (or even unspecified) shape:

    >>> cf1 = get_dynamic_shape.get_concrete_function(tf.TensorSpec(
    ...                                               shape=[None, 2]))
    tracing...
    static shape is (None, 2)
    >>> cf1(tf.constant([[1., 0],[1, 0],[1, 0]])).numpy()
    array([3, 2], dtype=int32)

    >>> cf2 = get_dynamic_shape.get_concrete_function(tf.TensorSpec(shape=None))
    tracing...
    static shape is <unknown>
    >>> cf2(tf.constant([[[[[1., 0]]]]])).numpy()
    array([1, 1, 1, 1, 2], dtype=int32)

    If a tensor is produced by an operation of type `"Foo"`, its shape
    may be inferred if there is a registered shape function for
    `"Foo"`. See [Shape
    functions](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/create_op#shape_functions_in_c)
    for details of shape functions and how to register them. Alternatively,
    you may set the shape explicitly using `tf.Tensor.ensure_shape`.

class Graph:
    """
    A TensorFlow computation, represented as a dataflow graph.

    Graphs are used by `tf.function`s to represent the function's computations.
    Each graph contains a set of `tf.Operation` objects, which represent units of
    computation; and `tf.Tensor` objects, which represent the units of data that
    flow between operations.

    ### Using graphs directly (deprecated)

    A `tf.Graph` can be constructed and used directly without a `tf.function`, as
    was required in TensorFlow 1, but this is deprecated and it is recommended to
    use a `tf.function` instead. If a graph is directly used, other deprecated
    TensorFlow 1 classes are also required to execute the graph, such as a
    `tf.compat.v1.Session`.

    A default graph can be registered with the `tf.Graph.as_default` context
    manager. Then, operations will be added to the graph instead of being executed
    eagerly. For example:

    ```python
    g = tf.Graph()
    with g.as_default():
      # Define operations and tensors in `g`.
      c = tf.constant(30.0)
      assert c.graph is g
    ```

    `tf.compat.v1.get_default_graph()` can be used to obtain the default graph.

    Important note: This class *is not* thread-safe for graph construction. All
    operations should be created from a single thread, or external
    synchronization must be provided. Unless otherwise specified, all methods
    are not thread-safe.

    A `Graph` instance supports an arbitrary number of "collections"
    that are identified by name. For convenience when building a large
    graph, collections can store groups of related objects: for
    example, the `tf.Variable` uses a collection (named
    `tf.GraphKeys.GLOBAL_VARIABLES`) for
    all variables that are created during the construction of a graph. The caller
    may define additional collections by specifying a new name.

        Returns a context manager that makes this `Graph` the default graph.

        This method should be used if you want to create multiple graphs
        in the same process. For convenience, a global default graph is
        provided, and all ops will be added to this graph if you do not
        create a new graph explicitly.

        Use this method with the `with` keyword to specify that ops created within
        the scope of a block should be added to this graph. In this case, once
        the scope of the `with` is exited, the previous default graph is set again
        as default. There is a stack, so it's ok to have multiple nested levels
        of `as_default` calls.

        The default graph is a property of the current thread. If you
        create a new thread, and wish to use the default graph in that
        thread, you must explicitly add a `with g.as_default():` in that
        thread's function.

        The following code examples are equivalent:

        ```python

class IndexedSlices(metaclass=ABCMeta):
    """
    A sparse representation of a set of tensor slices at given indices.

    This class is a simple wrapper for a pair of `Tensor` objects:

    * `values`: A `Tensor` of any dtype with shape `[D0, D1, ..., Dn]`.
    * `indices`: A 1-D integer `Tensor` with shape `[D0]`.

    An `IndexedSlices` is typically used to represent a subset of a larger
    tensor `dense` of shape `[LARGE0, D1, .. , DN]` where `LARGE0 >> D0`.
    The values in `indices` are the indices in the first dimension of
    the slices that have been extracted from the larger tensor.

    The dense tensor `dense` represented by an `IndexedSlices` `slices` has

    ```python
    dense[slices.indices[i], :, :, :, ...] = slices.values[i, :, :, :, ...]
    ```

    The `IndexedSlices` class is used principally in the definition of
    gradients for operations that have sparse gradients
    (e.g. `tf.gather`).

    >>> v = tf.Variable([[0.,1, 2], [2, 3, 4], [4, 5, 6], [6, 7, 8]])
    >>> with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    ...   r = tf.gather(v, [1,3])

           [1., 1., 1.]], dtype=float32)

class Module(AutoTrackable):
    """
    Base neural network module class.

    A module is a named container for `tf.Variable`s, other `tf.Module`s and
    functions which apply to user input. For example a dense layer in a neural
    network might be implemented as a `tf.Module`:

    >>> class Dense(tf.Module):
    ...   def __init__(self, input_dim, output_size, name=None):
    ...     super().__init__(name=name)
    ...     self.w = tf.Variable(
    ...       tf.random.normal([input_dim, output_size]), name='w')
    ...     self.b = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([output_size]), name='b')
    ...   def __call__(self, x):
    ...     y = tf.matmul(x, self.w) + self.b
    ...     return tf.nn.relu(y)

    You can use the Dense layer as you would expect:

    >>> d = Dense(input_dim=3, output_size=2)
    >>> d(tf.ones([1, 3]))
    <tf.Tensor: shape=(1, 2), dtype=float32, numpy=..., dtype=float32)>


    By subclassing `tf.Module` instead of `object` any `tf.Variable` or
    `tf.Module` instances assigned to object properties can be collected using
    the `variables`, `trainable_variables` or `submodules` property:

    >>> d.variables
        (<tf.Variable 'b:0' shape=(2,) dtype=float32, numpy=...,
        dtype=float32)>,
        <tf.Variable 'w:0' shape=(3, 2) dtype=float32, numpy=..., dtype=float32)>)


    Subclasses of `tf.Module` can also take advantage of the `_flatten` method
    which can be used to implement tracking of any other types.

    All `tf.Module` classes have an associated `tf.name_scope` which can be used
    to group operations in TensorBoard and create hierarchies for variable names
    which can help with debugging. We suggest using the name scope when creating
    nested submodules/parameters or for forward methods whose graph you might want
    to inspect in TensorBoard. You can enter the name scope explicitly using
    `with self.name_scope:` or you can annotate methods (apart from `__init__`)
    with `@tf.Module.with_name_scope`.

    ...   def __init__(self, input_size, sizes, name=None):

    Converts the given `value` to a `Tensor`.

    This function converts Python objects of various types to `Tensor`

    This function can be useful when composing a new operation in Python
    (such as `my_func` in the example above). All standard Python op
    constructors apply this function to each of their Tensor-valued
    inputs, which allows those ops to accept numpy arrays, Python lists,
    and scalars in addition to `Tensor` objects.

    Note: This function diverges from default Numpy behavior for `float` and
      `string` types when `None` is present in a Python list or scalar. Rather
      than silently converting `None` values, an error will be thrown.

    Args:
      value: An object whose type has a registered `Tensor` conversion function.
      dtype: Optional element type for the returned tensor. If missing, the type
        is inferred from the type of `value`.
      dtype_hint: Optional element type for the returned tensor, used when dtype
        is None. In some cases, a caller may not have a dtype in mind when
        converting to a tensor, so dtype_hint can be used as a soft preference. If
        the conversion to `dtype_hint` is not possible, this argument has no
        effect.
      name: Optional name to use if a new `Tensor` is created.

    Returns:
      A `Tensor` based on `value`.

    Raises:
      TypeError: If no conversion function is registered for `value` to `dtype`.
      RuntimeError: If a registered conversion function returns an invalid value.

    Returns a tensor with a length 1 axis inserted at index `axis`.

    Given a tensor `input`, this operation inserts a dimension of length 1 at the
    dimension index `axis` of `input`'s shape. The dimension index follows Python
    indexing rules: It's zero-based, and a negative index is counted backward
    from the end.

    This operation is useful to:

    * Add an outer "batch" dimension to a single element.
    * Align axes for broadcasting.
    * To add an inner vector length axis to a tensor of scalars.

    For example:

    If you have a single image of shape `[height, width, channels]`:

    [10, 1, 10, 3]

    Following standard Python indexing rules, a negative `axis` counts from the
    end so `axis=-1` adds an inner most dimension:

    >>> tf.expand_dims(image, -1).shape.as_list()
    [10, 10, 3, 1]

    This operation requires that `axis` is a valid index for `input.shape`,

    Note: If squeeze is performed on dimensions of unknown sizes, then the
    returned Tensor will be of unknown shape. A common situation is when the
    first (batch) dimension is of size `None`, `tf.squeeze` returns
    `<unknown>` shape which may be a surprise. Specify the `axis=` argument
    to get the expected result, as illustrated in the following example:

    ```python
    @tf.function
    def func(x):
      print('x.shape:', x.shape)
      known_axes = [i for i, size in enumerate(x.shape) if size == 1]
      y = tf.squeeze(x, axis=known_axes)
      print('shape of tf.squeeze(x, axis=known_axes):', y.shape)
      y = tf.squeeze(x)
      print('shape of tf.squeeze(x):', y.shape)
      return 0

    _ = func.get_concrete_function(tf.TensorSpec([None, 1, 2], dtype=tf.int32))
    # Output is.
    # x.shape: (None, 1, 2)
    # shape of tf.squeeze(x, axis=known_axes): (None, 2)
    # shape of tf.squeeze(x): <unknown>
    ```

    Args:
      input: A `Tensor`. The `input` to squeeze.
      axis: An optional list of `ints`. Defaults to `[]`. If specified, only
        squeezes the dimensions listed. The dimension index starts at 0. It is an
        error to squeeze a dimension that is not 1. Must be in the range
        `[-rank(input), rank(input))`. Must be specified if `input` is a
        `RaggedTensor`.
      name: A name for the operation (optional).

    Returns:
      A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `input`.
      Contains the same data as `input`, but has one or more dimensions of
      size 1 removed.

    Raises:
      ValueError: The input cannot be converted to a tensor, or the specified
        axis cannot be squeezed.

    tensor: TensorCompatible, indices: TensorCompatible, updates: TensorCompatible, name: str | None = None
) -> Tensor:
    """
    Scatter `updates` into an existing tensor according to `indices`.

    This operation creates a new tensor by applying sparse `updates` to the
    input `tensor`. This is similar to an index assignment.

    ```
    # Not implemented: tensors cannot be updated inplace.
    tensor[indices] = updates
    ```

    If an out of bound index is found on CPU, an error is returned.

    > **WARNING**: There are some GPU specific semantics for this operation.
    >
    > - If an out of bound index is found, the index is ignored.
    > - The order in which updates are applied is nondeterministic, so the output
    >   will be nondeterministic if `indices` contains duplicates.

    This operation is very similar to `tf.scatter_nd`, except that the updates are
    scattered onto an existing tensor (as opposed to a zero-tensor). If the memory
    for the existing tensor cannot be re-used, a copy is made and updated.

    In general:

    * `indices` is an integer tensor - the indices to update in `tensor`.
    * `indices` has **at least two** axes, the last axis is the depth of the
      index vectors.
    * For each index vector in `indices` there is a corresponding entry in
      `updates`.
    * If the length of the index vectors matches the rank of the `tensor`, then
      the index vectors each point to scalars in `tensor` and each update is a
      scalar.
    * If the length of the index vectors is less than the rank of `tensor`, then
      the index vectors each point to the slices of `tensor` and shape of the updates
      must match that slice.

    Overall this leads to the following shape constraints:

    ```
    assert tf.rank(indices) >= 2
    index_depth = indices.shape[-1]
    batch_shape = indices.shape[:-1]
    assert index_depth <= tf.rank(tensor)
    outer_shape = tensor.shape[:index_depth]
    inner_shape = tensor.shape[index_depth:]
    assert updates.shape == batch_shape + inner_shape
    ```

    Typical usage is often much simpler than this general form, and it
    can be better understood starting with simple examples:

    ### Scalar updates

    The simplest usage inserts scalar elements into a tensor by index.
    In this case, the `index_depth` must equal the rank of the
    input `tensor`, slice each column of `indices` is an index into an axis of the
    input `tensor`.

    In this simplest case the shape constraints are:

    ```
    num_updates, index_depth = indices.shape.as_list()
    assert updates.shape == [num_updates]
    assert index_depth == tf.rank(tensor)`
    ```

    For example, to insert 4 scattered elements in a rank-1 tensor with
    8 elements.

    <div style="width:70%; margin:auto; margin-bottom:10px; margin-top:20px;">
    <img style="width:100%"
      src="https://www.tensorflow.org/images/ScatterNd1.png">
    </div>

    This scatter operation would look like this:

    >>> tensor = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]    # tf.rank(tensor) == 1
    >>> indices = [[1], [3], [4], [7]]       # num_updates == 4, index_depth == 1
    >>> updates = [9, 10, 11, 12]            # num_updates == 4
    >>> print(tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update(tensor, indices, updates))
    tf.Tensor([ 0 9  0 10  11  0  0 12], shape=(8,), dtype=int32)

    The length (first axis) of `updates` must equal the length of the `indices`:
    `num_updates`. This is the number of updates being inserted. Each scalar
    update is inserted into `tensor` at the indexed location.

    For a higher rank input `tensor` scalar updates can be inserted by using an
    `index_depth` that matches `tf.rank(tensor)`:

    >>> tensor = [[1, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]]    # tf.rank(tensor) == 2
    >>> indices = [[0, 1], [2, 0]]           # num_updates == 2, index_depth == 2
    >>> updates = [5, 10]                    # num_updates == 2
    >>> print(tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update(tensor, indices, updates))
    tf.Tensor(
        [[ 1  5]
         [ 1  1]
         [10  1]], shape=(3, 2), dtype=int32)

    ### Slice updates

    When the input `tensor` has more than one axis scatter can be used to update
    entire slices.

    In this case it's helpful to think of the input `tensor` as being a two level
    array-of-arrays. The shape of this two level array is split into the
    `outer_shape` and the `inner_shape`.

    `indices` indexes into the outer level of the input tensor (`outer_shape`).
    and replaces the sub-array at that location with the corresponding item from
    the `updates` list. The shape of each update is `inner_shape`.

    When updating a list of slices the shape constraints are:

    ```
    num_updates, index_depth = indices.shape.as_list()
    outer_shape = tensor.shape[:index_depth]
    inner_shape = tensor.shape[index_depth:]
    assert updates.shape == [num_updates, inner_shape]
    ```

    For example, to update rows of a `(6, 3)` `tensor`:

    >>> tensor = tf.zeros([6, 3], dtype=tf.int32)

    Use an index depth of one.

    >>> indices = tf.constant([[2], [4]])     # num_updates == 2, index_depth == 1
    >>> num_updates, index_depth = indices.shape.as_list()

    The `outer_shape` is `6`, the inner shape is `3`:

    >>> outer_shape = tensor.shape[:index_depth]
    >>> inner_shape = tensor.shape[index_depth:]

    2 rows are being indexed so 2 `updates` must be supplied.
    Each update must be shaped to match the `inner_shape`.

    >>> # num_updates == 2, inner_shape==3
    >>> updates = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3],
    ...                        [4, 5, 6]])

    Altogether this gives:

    >>> tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update(tensor, indices, updates).numpy()
    array([[0, 0, 0],
           [0, 0, 0],
           [1, 2, 3],
           [0, 0, 0],
           [4, 5, 6],
           [0, 0, 0]], dtype=int32)

    #### More slice update examples

    A tensor representing a batch of uniformly sized video clips naturally has 5
    axes: `[batch_size, time, width, height, channels]`.

    For example:

    >>> batch_size, time, width, height, channels = 13,11,7,5,3
    >>> video_batch = tf.zeros([batch_size, time, width, height, channels])

    To replace a selection of video clips:
      * Use an `index_depth` of 1 (indexing the `outer_shape`: `[batch_size]`)
      * Provide updates each with a shape matching the `inner_shape`:
        `[time, width, height, channels]`.

    To replace the first two clips with ones:

    >>> indices = [[0],[1]]
    >>> new_clips = tf.ones([2, time, width, height, channels])
    >>> tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update(video_batch, indices, new_clips)

    To replace a selection of frames in the videos:

    * `indices` must have an `index_depth` of 2 for the `outer_shape`:
      `[batch_size, time]`.
    * `updates` must be shaped like a list of images.  Each update must have a
      shape, matching the `inner_shape`: `[width, height, channels]`.

    To replace the first frame of the first three video clips:

    >>> indices = [[0, 0], [1, 0], [2, 0]] # num_updates=3, index_depth=2
    >>> new_images = tf.ones([
    ...   # num_updates=3, inner_shape=(width, height, channels)
    ...   3, width, height, channels])
    >>> tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update(video_batch, indices, new_images)

    ### Folded indices

    In simple cases it's convenient to think of `indices` and `updates` as
    lists, but this is not a strict requirement. Instead of a flat `num_updates`,
    the `indices` and `updates` can be folded into a `batch_shape`. This
    `batch_shape` is all axes of the `indices`, except for the innermost
    `index_depth` axis.

    ```
    index_depth = indices.shape[-1]
    batch_shape = indices.shape[:-1]
    ```

    Note: The one exception is that the `batch_shape` cannot be `[]`. You can't
    update a single index by passing indices with shape `[index_depth]`.

    `updates` must have a matching `batch_shape` (the axes before `inner_shape`).

    ```
    assert updates.shape == batch_shape + inner_shape
    ```

    Note: The result is equivalent to flattening the `batch_shape` axes of
    `indices` and `updates`. This generalization just avoids the need
    for reshapes when it is more natural to construct "folded" indices and
    updates.

    With this generalization the full shape constraints are:

    ```
    assert tf.rank(indices) >= 2
    index_depth = indices.shape[-1]
    batch_shape = indices.shape[:-1]
    assert index_depth <= tf.rank(tensor)
    outer_shape = tensor.shape[:index_depth]
    inner_shape = tensor.shape[index_depth:]
    assert updates.shape == batch_shape + inner_shape
    ```

    For example, to draw an `X` on a `(5,5)` matrix start with these indices:

    >>> tensor = tf.zeros([5,5])
    >>> indices = tf.constant([
    ...  [[0,0],
    ...   [1,1],
    ...   [2,2],
    ...   [3,3],
    ...   [4,4]],
    ...  [[0,4],
    ...   [1,3],
    ...   [2,2],
    ...   [3,1],
    ...   [4,0]],
    ... ])
    >>> indices.shape.as_list()  # batch_shape == [2, 5], index_depth == 2
    [2, 5, 2]

    Here the `indices` do not have a shape of `[num_updates, index_depth]`, but a
    shape of `batch_shape+[index_depth]`.

    Since the `index_depth` is equal to the rank of `tensor`:

    * `outer_shape` is `(5,5)`
    * `inner_shape` is `()` - each update is scalar
    * `updates.shape` is `batch_shape + inner_shape == (5,2) + ()`

    >>> updates = [
    ...   [1,1,1,1,1],
    ...   [1,1,1,1,1],
    ... ]

    Putting this together gives:

    >>> tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update(tensor, indices, updates).numpy()
    array([[1., 0., 0., 0., 1.],
           [0., 1., 0., 1., 0.],
           [0., 0., 1., 0., 0.],
           [0., 1., 0., 1., 0.],
           [1., 0., 0., 0., 1.]], dtype=float32)

    Args:
      tensor: Tensor to copy/update.
      indices: Indices to update.
      updates: Updates to apply at the indices.
      name: Optional name for the operation.

    Returns:
      A new tensor with the given shape and updates applied according to the
      indices.

    """
    Creates a constant tensor from a tensor-like object.

    Note: All eager `tf.Tensor` values are immutable (in contrast to
    `tf.Variable`). There is nothing especially _constant_ about the value
    returned from `tf.constant`. This function is not fundamentally different from
    `tf.convert_to_tensor`. The name `tf.constant` comes from the `value` being
    embedded in a `Const` node in the `tf.Graph`. `tf.constant` is useful
    for asserting that the value can be embedded that way.

    If the argument `dtype` is not specified, then the type is inferred from
    the type of `value`.

    >>> # Constant 1-D Tensor from a python list.
    >>> tf.constant([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
    <tf.Tensor: shape=(6,), dtype=int32,

    >>> # Or a numpy array
    >>> a = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
    >>> tf.constant(a)
    <tf.Tensor: shape=(2, 3), dtype=int64, numpy=
      array([[1, 2, 3],
             [4, 5, 6]])>

    If `dtype` is specified, the resulting tensor values are cast to the requested
    `dtype`.

    >>> tf.constant([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], dtype=tf.float64)
    <tf.Tensor: shape=(6,), dtype=float64,
        numpy=array([1., 2., 3., 4., 5., 6.])>

    If `shape` is set, the `value` is reshaped to match. Scalars are expanded to
    fill the `shape`:

    >>> tf.constant(0, shape=(2, 3))
      <tf.Tensor: shape=(2, 3), dtype=int32, numpy=
      array([[0, 0, 0],
             [0, 0, 0]], dtype=int32)>
    >>> tf.constant([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], shape=[2, 3])

      array([[1, 2, 3],
             [4, 5, 6]], dtype=int32)>

    `tf.constant` has no effect if an eager Tensor is passed as the `value`, it
    even transmits gradients:

    >>> v = tf.Variable([0.0])
    >>> with tf.GradientTape() as g:
    ...     loss = tf.constant(v + v)
    >>> g.gradient(loss, v).numpy()
    array([2.], dtype=float32)

    But, since `tf.constant` embeds the value in the `tf.Graph` this fails for
    symbolic tensors:

    >>> with tf.compat.v1.Graph().as_default():
    ...   i = tf.compat.v1.placeholder(shape=[None, None], dtype=tf.float32)
    ...   t = tf.constant(i)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    TypeError: ...

    `tf.constant` will create tensors on the current device. Inputs which are
    already tensors maintain their placements unchanged.

    Related Ops:

    * `tf.convert_to_tensor` is similar but:
      * It has no `shape` argument.
      * Symbolic tensors are allowed to pass through.

      ...   i = tf.compat.v1.placeholder(shape=[None, None], dtype=tf.float32)
      ...   t = tf.convert_to_tensor(i)

    * `tf.fill`: differs in a few ways:
      *   `tf.constant` supports arbitrary constants, not just uniform scalar
          Tensors like `tf.fill`.
      *   `tf.fill` creates an Op in the graph that is expanded at runtime, so it
          can efficiently represent large tensors.
      *   Since `tf.fill` does not embed the value, it can produce dynamically
          sized outputs.

    >>> tf.dtypes.cast(x, tf.int32)
    <tf.Tensor: shape=(2,), dtype=int32, numpy=array([1, 2], dtype=int32)>

    The operation supports data types (for `x` and `dtype`) of
    `uint8`, `uint16`, `uint32`, `uint64`, `int8`, `int16`, `int32`, `int64`,
    `float16`, `float32`, `float64`, `complex64`, `complex128`, `bfloat16`.
    In case of casting from complex types (`complex64`, `complex128`) to real
    types, only the real part of `x` is returned. In case of casting from real
    types to complex types (`complex64`, `complex128`), the imaginary part of the
    returned value is set to `0`. The handling of complex types here matches the
    behavior of numpy.

    Note casting nan and inf values to integral types has undefined behavior.

    Note this operation can lead to a loss of precision when converting native
    Python `float` and `complex` variables to `tf.float64` or `tf.complex128`
    tensors, since the input is first converted to the `float32` data type and
    then widened. It is recommended to use `tf.convert_to_tensor` instead of
    `tf.cast` for any non-tensor inputs.

    Args:
      x: A `Tensor` or `SparseTensor` or `IndexedSlices` of numeric type. It could
        be `uint8`, `uint16`, `uint32`, `uint64`, `int8`, `int16`, `int32`,
        `int64`, `float16`, `float32`, `float64`, `complex64`, `complex128`,
        `bfloat16`.
      dtype: The destination type. The list of supported dtypes is the same as
        `x`.
      name: A name for the operation (optional).

    Returns:
      A `Tensor` or `SparseTensor` or `IndexedSlices` with same shape as `x` and
        same type as `dtype`.

    Raises:
      TypeError: If `x` cannot be cast to the `dtype`.

    Returns a tensor containing the shape of the input tensor.

    See also `tf.size`, `tf.rank`.

    `tf.shape` returns a 1-D integer tensor representing the shape of `input`.
    For a scalar input, the tensor returned has a shape of (0,) and its value is
    the empty vector (i.e. []).

    For example:

    >>> tf.shape(1.)
    <tf.Tensor: shape=(0,), dtype=int32, numpy=array([], dtype=int32)>

    >>> t = tf.constant([[[1, 1, 1], [2, 2, 2]], [[3, 3, 3], [4, 4, 4]]])
    >>> tf.shape(t)
    <tf.Tensor: shape=(3,), dtype=int32, numpy=array([2, 2, 3], dtype=int32)>

    Note: When using symbolic tensors, such as when using the Keras API,
    tf.shape() will return the shape of the symbolic tensor.

    >>> a = tf.keras.layers.Input((None, 10))
    >>> tf.shape(a)
    <... shape=(3,) dtype=int32...>

    In these cases, using `tf.Tensor.shape` will return more informative results.

    >>> a.shape
    TensorShape([None, None, 10])

    (The first `None` represents the as yet unknown batch size.)

    `tf.shape` and `Tensor.shape` should be identical in eager mode.  Within
    `tf.function` or within a `compat.v1` context, not all dimensions may be
    known until execution time. Hence, when defining custom layers and models
    for graph mode, prefer the dynamic `tf.shape(x)` over the static `x.shape`.

    Args:
      input: A `Tensor` or `SparseTensor`.
      out_type: (Optional) The specified output type of the operation (`int32` or
        `int64`). Defaults to `tf.int32`. (Note: there is an experimental
        flag, `tf_shape_default_int64` that changes the default to `tf.int64`.
        This is an unsupported, experimental setting that causes known breakages.)

      A `Tensor` of type `out_type`.

    Returns the indices of non-zero elements, or multiplexes `x` and `y`.

    This operation has two modes:

    1. **Return the indices of non-zero elements** - When only
       `condition` is provided the result is an `int64` tensor where each row is
       the index of a non-zero element of `condition`. The result's shape
       is `[tf.math.count_nonzero(condition), tf.rank(condition)]`.
    2. **Multiplex `x` and `y`** - When both `x` and `y` are provided the
       result has the shape of `x`, `y`, and `condition` broadcast together. The
       result is taken from `x` where `condition` is non-zero
       or `y` where `condition` is zero.

    #### 1. Return the indices of non-zero elements

    Note: In this mode `condition` can have a dtype of `bool` or any numeric
    dtype.

    If `x` and `y` are not provided (both are None):

    `tf.where` will return the indices of `condition` that are non-zero,
    in the form of a 2-D tensor with shape `[n, d]`, where `n` is the number of
    non-zero elements in `condition` (`tf.count_nonzero(condition)`), and `d` is
    the number of axes of `condition` (`tf.rank(condition)`).

    Indices are output in row-major order. The `condition` can have a `dtype` of
    `tf.bool`, or any numeric `dtype`.

    Here `condition` is a 1-axis `bool` tensor with 2 `True` values. The result
    has a shape of `[2,1]`

    >>> tf.where([True, False, False, True]).numpy()
    array([[0],
           [3]])

    Here `condition` is a 2-axis integer tensor, with 3 non-zero values. The
    result has a shape of `[3, 2]`.

    >>> tf.where([[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 1]]).numpy()
    array([[0, 0],
           [1, 0],
           [1, 2]])

    Here `condition` is a 3-axis float tensor, with 5 non-zero values. The output
    shape is `[5, 3]`.

    >>> float_tensor = [[[0.1, 0], [0, 2.2], [3.5, 1e6]],
    ...                 [[0,   0], [0,   0], [99,    0]]]
    >>> tf.where(float_tensor).numpy()
    array([[0, 0, 0],
           [0, 1, 1],
           [0, 2, 0],
           [0, 2, 1],
           [1, 2, 0]])

    These indices are the same that `tf.sparse.SparseTensor` would use to
    represent the condition tensor:

    >>> sparse = tf.sparse.from_dense(float_tensor)
    >>> sparse.indices.numpy()
    array([[0, 0, 0],
           [0, 1, 1],
           [0, 2, 0],
           [0, 2, 1],
           [1, 2, 0]])

    A complex number is considered non-zero if either the real or imaginary
    component is non-zero:

    >>> tf.where([complex(0.), complex(1.), 0+1j, 1+1j]).numpy()
    array([[1],
           [2],
           [3]])

    #### 2. Multiplex `x` and `y`

    Note: In this mode `condition` must have a dtype of `bool`.

    If `x` and `y` are also provided (both have non-None values) the `condition`
    tensor acts as a mask that chooses whether the corresponding
    element / row in the output should be taken from `x` (if the element in
    `condition` is `True`) or `y` (if it is `False`).

    The shape of the result is formed by
    [broadcasting](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/ufuncs.html)
    together the shapes of `condition`, `x`, and `y`.

    When all three inputs have the same size, each is handled element-wise.

    >>> tf.where([True, False, False, True],
    ...          [1, 2, 3, 4],
    ...          [100, 200, 300, 400]).numpy()
    array([  1, 200, 300,   4], dtype=int32)

    There are two main rules for broadcasting:

    1. If a tensor has fewer axes than the others, length-1 axes are added to the
       left of the shape.
    2. Axes with length-1 are streched to match the coresponding axes of the other
       tensors.

    A length-1 vector is streched to match the other vectors:

    >>> tf.where([True, False, False, True], [1, 2, 3, 4], [100]).numpy()
    array([  1, 100, 100,   4], dtype=int32)

    A scalar is expanded to match the other arguments:

    >>> tf.where([[True, False], [False, True]], [[1, 2], [3, 4]], 100).numpy()
    array([[  1, 100], [100,   4]], dtype=int32)
    >>> tf.where([[True, False], [False, True]], 1, 100).numpy()
    array([[  1, 100], [100,   1]], dtype=int32)

    A scalar `condition` returns the complete `x` or `y` tensor, with
    broadcasting applied.

    >>> tf.where(True, [1, 2, 3, 4], 100).numpy()
    array([1, 2, 3, 4], dtype=int32)
    >>> tf.where(False, [1, 2, 3, 4], 100).numpy()
    array([100, 100, 100, 100], dtype=int32)

    For a non-trivial example of broadcasting, here `condition` has a shape of
    `[3]`, `x` has a shape of `[3,3]`, and `y` has a shape of `[3,1]`.
    Broadcasting first expands the shape of `condition` to `[1,3]`. The final
    broadcast shape is `[3,3]`. `condition` will select columns from `x` and `y`.
    Since `y` only has one column, all columns from `y` will be identical.

    >>> tf.where([True, False, True],
    ...          x=[[1, 2, 3],
    ...             [4, 5, 6],
    ...             [7, 8, 9]],
    ...          y=[[100],
    ...             [200],
    ...             [300]]
    ... ).numpy()
    array([[ 1, 100, 3],
           [ 4, 200, 6],
           [ 7, 300, 9]], dtype=int32)

    Note that if the gradient of either branch of the `tf.where` generates
    a `NaN`, then the gradient of the entire `tf.where` will be `NaN`. This is
    because the gradient calculation for `tf.where` combines the two branches, for
    performance reasons.

    A workaround is to use an inner `tf.where` to ensure the function has
    no asymptote, and to avoid computing a value whose gradient is `NaN` by
    replacing dangerous inputs with safe inputs.

    Instead of this,

    >>> x = tf.constant(0., dtype=tf.float32)
    >>> with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    ...   tape.watch(x)
    ...   y = tf.where(x < 1., 0., 1. / x)
    >>> print(tape.gradient(y, x))
    tf.Tensor(nan, shape=(), dtype=float32)

    Although, the `1. / x` values are never used, its gradient is a `NaN` when
    `x = 0`. Instead, we should guard that with another `tf.where`

    >>> x = tf.constant(0., dtype=tf.float32)
    >>> with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    ...   tape.watch(x)
    ...   safe_x = tf.where(tf.equal(x, 0.), 1., x)
    ...   y = tf.where(x < 1., 0., 1. / safe_x)
    >>> print(tape.gradient(y, x))
    tf.Tensor(0.0, shape=(), dtype=float32)

    See also:

    * `tf.sparse` - The indices returned by the first form of `tf.where` can be
       useful in `tf.sparse.SparseTensor` objects.
    * `tf.gather_nd`, `tf.scatter_nd`, and related ops - Given the
      list of indices returned from `tf.where` the `scatter` and `gather` family
      of ops can be used fetch values or insert values at those indices.
    * `tf.strings.length` - `tf.string` is not an allowed dtype for the
      `condition`. Use the string length instead.

    Args:
      condition: A `tf.Tensor` of dtype bool, or any numeric dtype. `condition`

      x: If provided, a Tensor which is of the same type as `y`, and has a shape
        broadcastable with `condition` and `y`.
      y: If provided, a Tensor which is of the same type as `x`, and has a shape
        broadcastable with `condition` and `x`.
      name: A name of the operation (optional).

      If `x` and `y` are provided:
        A `Tensor` with the same type as `x` and `y`, and shape that
        is broadcast from `condition`, `x`, and `y`.
      Otherwise, a `Tensor` with shape `[tf.math.count_nonzero(condition),
      tf.rank(condition)]`.

    Raises:
      ValueError: When exactly one of `x` or `y` is non-None, or the shapes
        are not all broadcastable.

    Gather slices from `params` into a Tensor with shape specified by `indices`.

    `indices` is a `Tensor` of indices into `params`. The index vectors are
    arranged along the last axis of `indices`.

    This is similar to `tf.gather`, in which `indices` defines slices into the
    first dimension of `params`. In `tf.gather_nd`, `indices` defines slices into
    the first `N` dimensions of `params`, where `N = indices.shape[-1]`.

    ## Gathering scalars

    In the simplest case the vectors in `indices` index the full rank of `params`:

    >>> tf.gather_nd(
    ...     indices=[[0, 0],
    ...              [1, 1]],
    ...     params = [['a', 'b'],
    ...               ['c', 'd']]).numpy()
    array([b'a', b'd'], dtype=object)

    In this case the result has 1-axis fewer than `indices`, and each index vector
    is replaced by the scalar indexed from `params`.

    In this case the shape relationship is:

    ```
    index_depth = indices.shape[-1]
    assert index_depth == params.shape.rank
    result_shape = indices.shape[:-1]
    ```

    If `indices` has a rank of `K`, it is helpful to think `indices` as a
    (K-1)-dimensional tensor of indices into `params`.

    ## Gathering slices

    If the index vectors do not index the full rank of `params` then each location
    in the result contains a slice of params. This example collects rows from a
    matrix:

    >>> tf.gather_nd(
    ...     indices = [[1],
    ...                [0]],
    ...     params = [['a', 'b', 'c'],
    ...               ['d', 'e', 'f']]).numpy()
    array([[b'd', b'e', b'f'],
           [b'a', b'b', b'c']], dtype=object)

    Here `indices` contains `[2]` index vectors, each with a length of `1`.
    The index vectors each refer to rows of the `params` matrix. Each
    row has a shape of `[3]` so the output shape is `[2, 3]`.

    In this case, the relationship between the shapes is:

    ```
    index_depth = indices.shape[-1]
    outer_shape = indices.shape[:-1]
    assert index_depth <= params.shape.rank
    inner_shape = params.shape[index_depth:]
    output_shape = outer_shape + inner_shape
    ```

    It is helpful to think of the results in this case as tensors-of-tensors.
    The shape of the outer tensor is set by the leading dimensions of `indices`.
    While the shape of the inner tensors is the shape of a single slice.

    ## Batches

    Additionally, both `params` and `indices` can have `M` leading batch
    dimensions that exactly match. In this case `batch_dims` must be set to `M`.

    For example, to collect one row from each of a batch of matrices you could
    set the leading elements of the index vectors to be their location in the
    batch:

    >>> tf.gather_nd(
    ...     indices = [[0, 1],
    ...                [1, 0],
    ...                [2, 4],
    ...                [3, 2],
    ...                [4, 1]],
    ...     params=tf.zeros([5, 7, 3])).shape.as_list()
    [5, 3]

    The `batch_dims` argument lets you omit those leading location dimensions
    from the index:

    >>> tf.gather_nd(
    ...     batch_dims=1,
    ...     indices = [[1],
    ...                [0],
    ...                [4],
    ...                [2],
    ...                [1]],
    ...     params=tf.zeros([5, 7, 3])).shape.as_list()
    [5, 3]

    This is equivalent to caling a separate `gather_nd` for each location in the
    batch dimensions.


    >>> params=tf.zeros([5, 7, 3])
    >>> indices=tf.zeros([5, 1])
    >>> batch_dims = 1
    >>>
    >>> index_depth = indices.shape[-1]
    >>> batch_shape = indices.shape[:batch_dims]
    >>> assert params.shape[:batch_dims] == batch_shape
    >>> outer_shape = indices.shape[batch_dims:-1]
    >>> assert index_depth <= params.shape.rank
    >>> inner_shape = params.shape[batch_dims + index_depth:]
    >>> output_shape = batch_shape + outer_shape + inner_shape
    >>> output_shape.as_list()
    [5, 3]
