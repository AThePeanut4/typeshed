class LearningRateSchedule:
    """
    The learning rate schedule base class.

    You can use a learning rate schedule to modulate how the learning rate
    of your optimizer changes over time.

    Several built-in learning rate schedules are available, such as
    `keras.optimizers.schedules.ExponentialDecay` or
    `keras.optimizers.schedules.PiecewiseConstantDecay`:

    ```python
    lr_schedule = keras.optimizers.schedules.ExponentialDecay(
        initial_learning_rate=1e-2,
        decay_steps=10000,
        decay_rate=0.9)
    optimizer = keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=lr_schedule)
    ```

    A `LearningRateSchedule` instance can be passed in as the `learning_rate`
    argument of any optimizer.

    To implement your own schedule object, you should implement the `__call__`
    method, which takes a `step` argument (scalar integer tensor, the
    current training step count).
    Like for any other Keras object, you can also optionally
    make your object serializable by implementing the `get_config`
    and `from_config` methods.

    Example:

    ```python
    class MyLRSchedule(keras.optimizers.schedules.LearningRateSchedule):

        def __init__(self, initial_learning_rate):
            self.initial_learning_rate = initial_learning_rate

        def __call__(self, step):
            return self.initial_learning_rate / (step + 1)

    optimizer = keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=MyLRSchedule(0.1))
    ```

class PiecewiseConstantDecay(LearningRateSchedule):
    """
    A `LearningRateSchedule` that uses a piecewise constant decay schedule.

    The function returns a 1-arg callable to compute the piecewise constant
    when passed the current optimizer step. This can be useful for changing the
    learning rate value across different invocations of optimizer functions.

    Example: use a learning rate that's 1.0 for the first 100001 steps, 0.5
        for the next 10000 steps, and 0.1 for any additional steps.

    ```python
    step = ops.array(0)
    boundaries = [100000, 110000]
    values = [1.0, 0.5, 0.1]

        boundaries, values)

    # Later, whenever we perform an optimization step, we pass in the step.
    learning_rate = learning_rate_fn(step)
    ```

    You can pass this schedule directly into a `keras.optimizers.Optimizer`
    as the learning rate. The learning rate schedule is also serializable and
    deserializable using `keras.optimizers.schedules.serialize` and
    `keras.optimizers.schedules.deserialize`.

        boundaries: A list of Python numbers with strictly increasing
            entries, and with all elements having the same type as the
            optimizer step.
        values: A list of Python numbers that specifies the values for the
            intervals defined by `boundaries`. It should have one more
            element than `boundaries`, and all elements should have the same
            type.

        step and outputs the decayed learning rate, a scalar tensor of the
        same type as the boundary tensors.

        The output of the 1-arg function that takes the `step`
        is `values[0]` when `step <= boundaries[0]`,
        `values[1]` when `step > boundaries[0]` and `step <= boundaries[1]`,
        ..., and `values[-1]` when `step > boundaries[-1]`.

    See [Loshchilov & Hutter, ICLR2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03983),
    SGDR: Stochastic Gradient Descent with Warm Restarts.

    For the idea of a linear warmup of our learning rate,
    see [Goyal et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.02677.pdf).

    When we begin training a model, we often want an initial increase in our
    learning rate followed by a decay. If `warmup_target` is an int, this
    schedule applies a linear increase per optimizer step to our learning rate
    from `initial_learning_rate` to `warmup_target` for a duration of
    `warmup_steps`. Afterwards, it applies a cosine decay function taking our
    learning rate from `warmup_target` to `alpha` for a duration of
    `decay_steps`. If `warmup_target` is None we skip warmup and our decay
    will take our learning rate from `initial_learning_rate` to `alpha`.
    It requires a `step` value to  compute the learning rate. You can
    just pass a backend variable that you increment at each training step.

    The schedule is a 1-arg callable that produces a warmup followed by a
    decayed learning rate when passed the current optimizer step. This can be
    useful for changing the learning rate value across different invocations of
    optimizer functions.

    Our warmup is computed as:

    ```python
    def warmup_learning_rate(step):
        completed_fraction = step / warmup_steps
        total_delta = target_warmup - initial_learning_rate
        return completed_fraction * total_delta
    ```

    And our decay is computed as:

    ```python
    if warmup_target is None:
        initial_decay_lr = initial_learning_rate
    else:
        initial_decay_lr = warmup_target

    def decayed_learning_rate(step):

        decayed = (1 - alpha) * cosine_decay + alpha
        return initial_decay_lr * decayed

    Example usage without warmup:

    ```python
    decay_steps = 1000
    initial_learning_rate = 0.1
    lr_decayed_fn = keras.optimizers.schedules.CosineDecay(
        initial_learning_rate, decay_steps)

        staircase: Boolean.  If `True` decay the learning rate at discrete

        A 1-arg callable learning rate schedule that takes the current optimizer
        step and outputs the decayed learning rate, a scalar tensor of the
        same type as `initial_learning_rate`.
