    Atrous convolution (a.k.a. convolution with holes or dilated convolution).

    This function is a simpler wrapper around the more general
    `tf.nn.convolution`, and exists only for backwards compatibility. You can
    use `tf.nn.convolution` to perform 1-D, 2-D, or 3-D atrous convolution.

    Computes a 2-D atrous convolution, also known as convolution with holes or
    dilated convolution, given 4-D `value` and `filters` tensors. If the `rate`
    parameter is equal to one, it performs regular 2-D convolution. If the `rate`
    parameter is greater than one, it performs convolution with holes, sampling
    the input values every `rate` pixels in the `height` and `width` dimensions.
    This is equivalent to convolving the input with a set of upsampled filters,
    produced by inserting `rate - 1` zeros between two consecutive values of the
    filters along the `height` and `width` dimensions, hence the name atrous
    convolution or convolution with holes (the French word trous means holes in
    English).

    More specifically:

    ```
    output[batch, height, width, out_channel] =
        sum_{dheight, dwidth, in_channel} (
            filters[dheight, dwidth, in_channel, out_channel] *
            value[batch, height + rate*dheight, width + rate*dwidth, in_channel]
        )
    ```

    Atrous convolution allows us to explicitly control how densely to compute
    feature responses in fully convolutional networks. Used in conjunction with
    bilinear interpolation, it offers an alternative to `conv2d_transpose` in
    dense prediction tasks such as semantic image segmentation, optical flow
    computation, or depth estimation. It also allows us to effectively enlarge
    the field of view of filters without increasing the number of parameters or
    the amount of computation.

    For a description of atrous convolution and how it can be used for dense
    feature extraction, please see: (Chen et al., 2015). The same operation is
    investigated further in (Yu et al., 2016). Previous works that effectively
    use atrous convolution in different ways are, among others,
    (Sermanet et al., 2014) and (Giusti et al., 2013).
    Atrous convolution is also closely related to the so-called noble identities
    in multi-rate signal processing.

    There are many different ways to implement atrous convolution (see the refs
    above). The implementation here reduces

    ```python
    atrous_conv2d(value, filters, rate, padding=padding)
    ```

    to the following three operations:

    ```python
    paddings = ...
    net = space_to_batch(value, paddings, block_size=rate)
    net = conv2d(net, filters, strides=[1, 1, 1, 1], padding="VALID")
    crops = ...
    net = batch_to_space(net, crops, block_size=rate)
    ```

    Advanced usage. Note the following optimization: A sequence of `atrous_conv2d`
    operations with identical `rate` parameters, 'SAME' `padding`, and filters
    with odd heights/ widths:

    ```python
    net = atrous_conv2d(net, filters1, rate, padding="SAME")
    net = atrous_conv2d(net, filters2, rate, padding="SAME")
    ...
    net = atrous_conv2d(net, filtersK, rate, padding="SAME")
    ```

    can be equivalently performed cheaper in terms of computation and memory as:

    ```python
    pad = ...  # padding so that the input dims are multiples of rate
    net = space_to_batch(net, paddings=pad, block_size=rate)
    net = conv2d(net, filters1, strides=[1, 1, 1, 1], padding="SAME")
    net = conv2d(net, filters2, strides=[1, 1, 1, 1], padding="SAME")
    ...
    net = conv2d(net, filtersK, strides=[1, 1, 1, 1], padding="SAME")
    net = batch_to_space(net, crops=pad, block_size=rate)
    ```

    because a pair of consecutive `space_to_batch` and `batch_to_space` ops with
    the same `block_size` cancel out when their respective `paddings` and `crops`
    inputs are identical.

    Args:
      value: A 4-D `Tensor` of type `float`. It needs to be in the default "NHWC"
        format. Its shape is `[batch, in_height, in_width, in_channels]`.
      filters: A 4-D `Tensor` with the same type as `value` and shape
        `[filter_height, filter_width, in_channels, out_channels]`. `filters`'
        `in_channels` dimension must match that of `value`. Atrous convolution is
        equivalent to standard convolution with upsampled filters with effective
        height `filter_height + (filter_height - 1) * (rate - 1)` and effective
        width `filter_width + (filter_width - 1) * (rate - 1)`, produced by
        inserting `rate - 1` zeros along consecutive elements across the
        `filters`' spatial dimensions.
      rate: A positive int32. The stride with which we sample input values across
        the `height` and `width` dimensions. Equivalently, the rate by which we
        upsample the filter values by inserting zeros across the `height` and
        `width` dimensions. In the literature, the same parameter is sometimes
        called `input stride` or `dilation`.
      padding: A string, either `'VALID'` or `'SAME'`. The padding algorithm. See
        [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn#notes_on_padding_2)
        for more information.
      name: Optional name for the returned tensor.

    Returns:
      A `Tensor` with the same type as `value`.
      Output shape with `'VALID'` padding is:

          [batch, height - rate * (filter_width - 1),
           width - rate * (filter_height - 1), out_channels].

      Output shape with `'SAME'` padding is:

          [batch, height, width, out_channels].

    Raises:
      ValueError: If input/output depth does not match `filters`' shape, or if
        padding is other than `'VALID'` or `'SAME'`.

    Batch normalization.

        size as the 'depth' dimension.
        This is the case for example for the common `[batch, depth]` layout of

    Internally, this op reshapes the input tensors and invokes `tf.nn.conv2d`.
    For example, if `data_format` does not start with `"NC"`, a tensor of shape
      `batch_shape + [in_width, in_channels]`
    is reshaped to
      `batch_shape + [1, in_width, in_channels]`,

    \(where out_width is a function of the stride and padding as in conv2d\) and
    returned to the caller.

    Computes a 2-D convolution given `input` and 4-D `filters` tensors.

    The `input` tensor may have rank `4` or higher, where shape dimensions `[:-3]`
    are considered batch dimensions (`batch_shape`).

    Given an input tensor of shape
    `batch_shape + [in_height, in_width, in_channels]` and a filter / kernel
    tensor of shape `[filter_height, filter_width, in_channels, out_channels]`,
    this op performs the following:

    1. Flattens the filter to a 2-D matrix with shape
       `[filter_height * filter_width * in_channels, output_channels]`.
    2. Extracts image patches from the input tensor to form a *virtual*
       tensor of shape `[batch, out_height, out_width,
       filter_height * filter_width * in_channels]`.
    3. For each patch, right-multiplies the filter matrix and the image patch
       vector.

    In detail, with the default NHWC format,

        output[b, i, j, k] =
            sum_{di, dj, q} input[b, strides[1] * i + di, strides[2] * j + dj, q] *
                            filter[di, dj, q, k]

    Must have `strides[0] = strides[3] = 1`.  For the most common case of the same
    horizontal and vertical strides, `strides = [1, stride, stride, 1]`.

    Usage Example:

    >>> x_in = np.array([[
    ...   [[2], [1], [2], [0], [1]],
    ...   [[1], [3], [2], [2], [3]],

        as batch dimensions. See below for details.
      filters: A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `input`.
        A 4-D tensor of shape
        `[filter_height, filter_width, in_channels, out_channels]`

        the `N` and `C` dimensions are set to 1. The dimension order is determined
        by the value of `data_format`, see below for details.
      padding: Either the `string` `"SAME"` or `"VALID"` indicating the type of
        padding algorithm to use, or a list indicating the explicit paddings at
        the start and end of each dimension. See

        `"NHWC"`, this should be in the form `[[0, 0], [pad_top, pad_bottom],
        [pad_left, pad_right], [0, 0]]`. When explicit padding used and
        data_format is `"NCHW"`, this should be in the form `[[0, 0], [0, 0],

      data_format: An optional `string` from: `"NHWC", "NCHW"`.
        Defaults to `"NHWC"`.
        Specify the data format of the input and output data. With the
        default format "NHWC", the data is stored in the order of:
            `batch_shape + [height, width, channels]`.
        Alternatively, the format could be "NCHW", the data storage order of:

        stride of the sliding window for each dimension of `input`. If a single
        value is given it is replicated in the spatial dimensions. By default
        the `N` and `C` dimensions are set to 0. The dimension order is determined
        by the value of `data_format`, see below for details.
      padding: A string, either `'VALID'` or `'SAME'`. The padding algorithm. See
        [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn#notes_on_padding_2)
        for more information.
      data_format: A string or None.  Specifies whether the channel dimension of
        the `input` and output is the last dimension (default, or if `data_format`
        does not start with "NC"), or the second dimension (if `data_format`
        starts with "NC").  For N=1, the valid values are "NWC" (default) and
        "NCW".  For N=2, the valid values are "NHWC" (default) and "NCHW".
        For N=3, the valid values are "NDHWC" (default) and "NCDHW".
      dilations: An int or list of `ints` that has length `1`, `N` or `N+2`,
        defaults to 1. The dilation factor for each dimension of`input`. If a
        single value is given it is replicated in the spatial dimensions. By
        default the `N` and `C` dimensions are set to 1. If set to k > 1, there
        will be k-1 skipped cells between each filter element on that dimension.
        The dimension order is determined by the value of `data_format`, see above
        for details.
      name: A name for the operation (optional). If not specified "conv_transpose"
        is used.

    Returns:
      A `Tensor` with the same type as `value`.

    Computes sums of N-D convolutions (actually cross-correlation).

    This also supports either output striding via the optional `strides` parameter
    or atrous convolution (also known as convolution with holes or dilated
    convolution, based on the French word "trous" meaning holes in English) via
    the optional `dilations` parameter.  Currently, however, output striding
    is not supported for atrous convolutions.

    Specifically, in the case that `data_format` does not start with "NC", given
    a rank (N+2) `input` Tensor of shape

      [num_batches,
       input_spatial_shape[0],
       ...,
       input_spatial_shape[N-1],
       num_input_channels],

    a rank (N+2) `filters` Tensor of shape

      [spatial_filter_shape[0],
       ...,
       spatial_filter_shape[N-1],
       num_input_channels,
       num_output_channels],

    an optional `dilations` tensor of shape N (defaults to `[1]*N`) specifying
    the filter upsampling/input downsampling rate, and an optional list of N
    `strides` (defaults to `[1]*N`), this computes for each N-D spatial output
    position `(x[0], ..., x[N-1])`:

    ```
    output[b, x[0], ..., x[N-1], k] =
        sum_{z[0], ..., z[N-1], q}
            filter[z[0], ..., z[N-1], q, k] *
            padded_input[b,
                         x[0]*strides[0] + dilation_rate[0]*z[0],
                         ...,
                         x[N-1]*strides[N-1] + dilation_rate[N-1]*z[N-1],
                         q]
    ```

    where b is the index into the batch, k is the output channel number, q is the
    input channel number, and z is the N-D spatial offset within the filter. Here,
    `padded_input` is obtained by zero padding the input using an effective
    spatial filter shape of `(spatial_filter_shape-1) * dilation_rate + 1` and
    output striding `strides`.

    In the case that `data_format` does start with `"NC"`, the `input` and output
    (but not the `filters`) are simply transposed as follows:

    ```python
    convolution(input, data_format, **kwargs) =
      tf.transpose(convolution(tf.transpose(input, [0] + range(2,N+2) + [1]),
                               **kwargs),
                   [0, N+1] + range(1, N+1))
    ```

    It is required that 1 <= N <= 3.

    Args:
      input: An (N+2)-D `Tensor` of type `T`, of shape
        `[batch_size] + input_spatial_shape + [in_channels]` if data_format does
        not start with "NC" (default), or
        `[batch_size, in_channels] + input_spatial_shape` if data_format starts
        with "NC".
      filters: An (N+2)-D `Tensor` with the same type as `input` and shape
        `spatial_filter_shape + [in_channels, out_channels]`.
      padding: A string, either `"VALID"` or `"SAME"`. The padding algorithm.
        `"valid"` means no padding. `"same"` results in padding evenly to
        the left/right or up/down of the input such that output has the same
        height/width dimension as the input when the strides are 1. See
        [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn#notes_on_padding_2)
        for more information.
      strides: Optional.  Sequence of N ints >= 1.  Specifies the output stride.
        Defaults to `[1]*N`.  If any value of strides is > 1, then all values of
        dilation_rate must be 1.
      dilations: Optional.  Sequence of N ints >= 1.  Specifies the filter
        upsampling/input downsampling rate.  In the literature, the same parameter
        is sometimes called `input stride` or `dilation`.  The effective filter
        size used for the convolution will be `spatial_filter_shape +
        (spatial_filter_shape - 1) * (rate - 1)`, obtained by inserting
        (dilation_rate[i]-1) zeros between consecutive elements of the original
        filter in each spatial dimension i.  If any value of dilation_rate is > 1,
        then all values of strides must be 1.
      name: Optional name for the returned tensor.
      data_format: A string or None.  Specifies whether the channel dimension of
        the `input` and output is the last dimension (default, or if `data_format`
        does not start with "NC"), or the second dimension (if `data_format`
        starts with "NC").  For N=1, the valid values are "NWC" (default) and

        For N=3, the valid values are "NDHWC" (default) and "NCDHW".

    Returns:
      A `Tensor` with the same type as `input` of shape

          `[batch_size] + output_spatial_shape + [out_channels]`

      if data_format is None or does not start with "NC", or

          `[batch_size, out_channels] + output_spatial_shape`

      if data_format starts with "NC",

    This op implements the CTC loss as presented in
    [Graves et al., 2006](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~graves/icml_2006.pdf)

    Connectionist temporal classification (CTC) is a type of neural network output
    and associated scoring function, for training recurrent neural networks (RNNs)
    such as LSTM networks to tackle sequence problems where the timing is
    variable. It can be used for tasks like on-line handwriting recognition or
    recognizing phones in speech audio. CTC refers to the outputs and scoring, and
    is independent of the underlying neural network structure.

    Notes:

    - This class performs the softmax operation for you, so `logits` should be
      e.g. linear projections of outputs by an LSTM.
    - Outputs true repeated classes with blanks in between, and can also output
      repeated classes with no blanks in between that need to be collapsed by the
      decoder.
    - `labels` may be supplied as either a dense, zero-padded `Tensor` with a
      vector of label sequence lengths OR as a `SparseTensor`.
    - On TPU: Only dense padded `labels` are supported.
    - On CPU and GPU: Caller may use `SparseTensor` or dense padded `labels`
      but calling with a `SparseTensor` will be significantly faster.
    - Default blank label is `0` instead of `num_labels - 1` (where `num_labels`
      is the innermost dimension size of `logits`), unless overridden by
      `blank_index`.

    Looks up embeddings for the given `ids` from a list of tensors.

    This function is used to perform parallel lookups on the list of tensors in

    interpreted as a partitioning of a large embedding tensor.

    If `len(params) > 1`, each element `id` of `ids` is partitioned between the
    elements of `params` according to the "div" partition strategy, which means we
    assign ids to partitions in a contiguous manner. For instance, 13 ids are

    Looks up embeddings for the given `ids` from a list of tensors.

    This function is used to perform parallel lookups on the list of tensors in
    `params`.  It is a generalization of `tf.gather`, where `params` is
    interpreted as a partitioning of a large embedding tensor.

    If `len(params) > 1`, each element `id` of `ids` is partitioned between the
    elements of `params` according to the "div" partition strategy, which means we
    assign ids to partitions in a contiguous manner. For instance, 13 ids are
    split across 5 partitions as:
    `[[0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8], [9, 10], [11, 12]]`.

    If the id space does not evenly divide the number of partitions, each of the
    first `(max_id + 1) % len(params)` partitions will be assigned one more id.

    The results of the lookup are concatenated into a dense
    tensor. The returned tensor has shape `shape(ids) + shape(params)[1:]`.

    Args:
      params: A single tensor representing the complete embedding tensor, or a
        list of tensors all of same shape except for the first dimension,
        representing sharded embedding tensors following "div" partition strategy.
      ids: A `Tensor` with type `int32` or `int64` containing the ids to be looked
        up in `params`.
      max_norm: If not `None`, each embedding is clipped if its l2-norm is larger
        than this value.
      name: A name for the operation (optional).

    Returns:
      A `Tensor` with the same type as the tensors in `params`.

      For instance, if `params` is a 5x2 matrix:

    Computes log Poisson loss given `log_input`.

    Gives the log-likelihood loss between the prediction and the target under the
    assumption that the target has a Poisson distribution.
    Caveat: By default, this is not the exact loss, but the loss minus a
      constant term [log(z!)]. That has no effect for optimization, but
      does not play well with relative loss comparisons. To compute an
      approximation of the log factorial term, specify
      compute_full_loss=True to enable Stirling's Approximation.

    For brevity, let `c = log(x) = log_input`, `z = targets`.  The log Poisson

def sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_logits(labels: TensorCompatible, logits: TensorCompatible, name: str | None = None) -> Tensor:
    r"""
    Computes sigmoid cross entropy given `logits`.

    Measures the probability error in tasks with two outcomes in which each
    outcome is independent and need not have a fully certain label. For instance,
    one could perform a regression where the probability of an event happening is
    known and used as a label. This loss may also be used for binary
    classification, where labels are either zero or one.

    For brevity, let `x = logits`, `z = labels`.  The logistic loss is

          z * -log(sigmoid(x)) + (1 - z) * -log(1 - sigmoid(x))
        = z * -log(1 / (1 + exp(-x))) + (1 - z) * -log(exp(-x) / (1 + exp(-x)))

        = (1 - z) * x + log(1 + exp(-x))
        = x - x * z + log(1 + exp(-x))

    For x < 0, to avoid overflow in exp(-x), we reformulate the above

          x - x * z + log(1 + exp(-x))
        = log(exp(x)) - x * z + log(1 + exp(-x))
        = - x * z + log(1 + exp(x))

    Hence, to ensure stability and avoid overflow, the implementation uses this
    equivalent formulation

        max(x, 0) - x * z + log(1 + exp(-abs(x)))

    `logits` and `labels` must have the same type and shape.

    >>> logits = tf.constant([1., -1., 0., 1., -1., 0., 0.])

           0.6931472], dtype=float32)

    Compared to the losses which handle multiple outcomes,
    `tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits` for general multi-class
    classification and `tf.nn.sparse_softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits` for more
    efficient multi-class classification with hard labels,
    `sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_logits` is a slight simplification for binary
    classification:

          sigmoid(x) = softmax([x, 0])[0]

    $$\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}} = \frac{e^x}{e^x + e^0}$$

    While `sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_logits` works for soft binary labels
    (probabilities between 0 and 1), it can also be used for binary classification
    where the labels are hard. There is an equivalence between all three symbols
    in this case, with a probability 0 indicating the second class or 1 indicating
    the first class:

    Lookup embedding results, accounting for invalid IDs and empty features.

    The partitioned embedding in `embedding_weights` must all be the same shape
    except for the first dimension. The first dimension is allowed to vary as the
    vocabulary size is not necessarily a multiple of num of shards.

    This is similar to `tf.nn.embedding_lookup_sparse`, except invalid IDs (< 0)
    are pruned from input IDs and weights, as well as any IDs with non-positive
    weight. For an entry with no features, the embedding vector for `default_id`
    is returned, or the 0-vector if `default_id` is not supplied. See
    `tf.nn.embedding_lookup_sparse` for more information on how sparse embedding
    lookups work in general.

    The ids and weights may be multi-dimensional `SparseTensor`s or
    `RaggedTensor`s with rank of 2. For `SpareTensor`s with left-aligned non-zero
    entries which can be described as `RaggedTensor`s, use of `RaggedTensor`s can
    yield higher performance.

    If `len(embedding_weights) > 1`, each element `id` of `ids` is partitioned
    between the elements of `embedding_weights` according to the "div" partition
    strategy, which means we assign ids to partitions in a contiguous manner. For
    instance, 13 ids are split across 5 partitions as:
    `[[0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8], [9, 10], [11, 12]]`.

    If the id space does not evenly divide the number of partitions, each of the
    first `(max_id + 1) % len(embedding_weights)` partitions will be assigned one
    more id.

    Args:
      embedding_weights: A single tensor representing the complete embedding
        tensor, or a list of tensors all of same shape except for the first
        dimension, representing sharded embedding tensors following "div"
        partition strategy.
      sparse_ids: `SparseTensor` of shape `[d_0, d_1, ..., d_n]` containing the
        ids, where `d_0` is typically batch size, or a `RaggedTensor` with rank 2.
      sparse_weights: `SparseTensor` or `RaggedTensor` of same type and shape as
        `sparse_ids`, containing float weights corresponding to `sparse_ids`, or
        `None` if all weights are assumed to be 1.0.
      combiner: A string specifying how to combine embedding results for each
        entry. Currently "mean", "sqrtn" and "sum" are supported, with "mean" the
        default.
      default_id: The id to use for an entry with no features. Defaults to
        0-vector.
      max_norm: If not `None`, all embeddings are l2-normalized to max_norm before
        combining.
      name: A name for this operation (optional).
      allow_fast_lookup: An optional boolean specifying whether to allow
        simplified embedding lookups when `params` is a single tensor and
        `max_norm` is `None`. Setting this flag to `True` during training can
        cause the use of dense gradients with increased memory footprint.

    Returns:
      A dense tensor representing the combined embeddings for the
      sparse ids. For each row in the dense tensor represented by `sparse_ids`,
      the op looks up the embeddings for all ids in that row, multiplies them by
      the corresponding weight, and combines these embeddings as specified.

      In other words, if

        `shape(combined embedding_weights) = [p0, p1, ..., pm]`

      and

        `shape(sparse_ids) = shape(sparse_weights) = [d0, d1, ..., dn]`

      then

        `shape(output) = [d0, d1, ... dn-1, p1, ..., pm]`.

      For instance, if params is a 10x20 matrix, and sp_ids / sp_weights are

        ```python
        [0, 0]: id 1, weight 2.0
        [0, 1]: id 3, weight 0.5
        [1, 0]: id -1, weight 1.0
        [2, 3]: id 1, weight 3.0
        ```

      `default_id` is 0.

      with `combiner`="mean", then the output will be a 3x20 matrix where

        ```python
        output[0, :] = (params[1, :] * 2.0 + params[3, :] * 0.5) / (2.0 + 0.5)
