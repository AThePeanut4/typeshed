:mod:`itertools` is full of great examples of Python generator
usage. However, there are still some critical gaps. ``iterutils``
fills many of those gaps with featureful, tested, and Pythonic
solutions.

Many of the functions below have two versions, one which
returns an iterator (denoted by the ``*_iter`` naming pattern), and a
shorter-named convenience form that returns a list. Some of the
following are based on examples in itertools docs.

    The remap ("recursive map") function is used to traverse and
    transform nested structures. Lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries
    are just a few of the data structures nested into heterogeneous
    tree-like structures that are so common in programming.
    Unfortunately, Python's built-in ways to manipulate collections
    are almost all flat. List comprehensions may be fast and succinct,
    but they do not recurse, making it tedious to apply quick changes
    or complex transforms to real-world data.

    remap goes where list comprehensions cannot.

    Here's an example of removing all Nones from some data:

    >>> from pprint import pprint
    >>> reviews = {'Star Trek': {'TNG': 10, 'DS9': 8.5, 'ENT': None},
    ...            'Babylon 5': 6, 'Dr. Who': None}
    >>> pprint(remap(reviews, lambda p, k, v: v is not None))
    {'Babylon 5': 6, 'Star Trek': {'DS9': 8.5, 'TNG': 10}}

    Notice how both Nones have been removed despite the nesting in the
    dictionary. Not bad for a one-liner, and that's just the beginning.
    See `this remap cookbook`_ for more delicious recipes.

    .. _this remap cookbook: http://sedimental.org/remap.html

    remap takes four main arguments: the object to traverse and three
    optional callables which determine how the remapped object will be
    created.

    Args:

        root: The target object to traverse. By default, remap
            supports iterables like :class:`list`, :class:`tuple`,
            :class:`dict`, and :class:`set`, but any object traversable by
            *enter* will work.
        visit (callable): This function is called on every item in
            *root*. It must accept three positional arguments, *path*,
            *key*, and *value*. *path* is simply a tuple of parents'
            keys. *visit* should return the new key-value pair. It may
            also return ``True`` as shorthand to keep the old item
            unmodified, or ``False`` to drop the item from the new
            structure. *visit* is called after *enter*, on the new parent.

            The *visit* function is called for every item in root,
            including duplicate items. For traversable values, it is
            called on the new parent object, after all its children
            have been visited. The default visit behavior simply
            returns the key-value pair unmodified.
        enter (callable): This function controls which items in *root*
            are traversed. It accepts the same arguments as *visit*: the
            path, the key, and the value of the current item. It returns a
            pair of the blank new parent, and an iterator over the items
            which should be visited. If ``False`` is returned instead of
            an iterator, the value will not be traversed.

            The *enter* function is only called once per unique value. The
            default enter behavior support mappings, sequences, and
            sets. Strings and all other iterables will not be traversed.
        exit (callable): This function determines how to handle items
            once they have been visited. It gets the same three
            arguments as the other functions -- *path*, *key*, *value*
            -- plus two more: the blank new parent object returned
            from *enter*, and a list of the new items, as remapped by
            *visit*.

            Like *enter*, the *exit* function is only called once per
            unique value. The default exit behavior is to simply add
            all new items to the new parent, e.g., using
            :meth:`list.extend` and :meth:`dict.update` to add to the
            new parent. Immutable objects, such as a :class:`tuple` or
            :class:`namedtuple`, must be recreated from scratch, but
            use the same type as the new parent passed back from the
            *enter* function.
        reraise_visit (bool): A pragmatic convenience for the *visit*
            callable. When set to ``False``, remap ignores any errors
            raised by the *visit* callback. Items causing exceptions
            are kept. See examples for more details.
        trace (bool): Pass ``trace=True`` to print out the entire
            traversal. Or pass a tuple of ``'visit'``, ``'enter'``,
            or ``'exit'`` to print only the selected events.

    remap is designed to cover the majority of cases with just the
    *visit* callable. While passing in multiple callables is very
    empowering, remap is designed so very few cases should require
    passing more than one function.

    When passing *enter* and *exit*, it's common and easiest to build
    on the default behavior. Simply add ``from boltons.iterutils import
    default_enter`` (or ``default_exit``), and have your enter/exit
    function call the default behavior before or after your custom
    logic. See `this example`_.

    Duplicate and self-referential objects (aka reference loops) are
    automatically handled internally, `as shown here`_.

class PathAccessError(KeyError, IndexError, TypeError):
    """
    An amalgamation of KeyError, IndexError, and TypeError,

    >>> root = {'a': {'b': {'c': [[1], [2], [3]]}}}
    >>> get_path(root, ('a', 'b', 'c', 2, 0))
    3

    The path tuple format is intentionally consistent with that of
    :func:`remap`, but a single dotted string can also be passed.

    One of get_path's chief aims is improved error messaging. EAFP is
    great, but the error messages are not.

    For instance, ``root['a']['b']['c'][2][1]`` gives back
    ``IndexError: list index out of range``

    What went out of range where? get_path currently raises
    ``PathAccessError: could not access 2 from path ('a', 'b', 'c', 2,
    1), got error: IndexError('list index out of range',)``, a
    subclass of IndexError and KeyError.

    You can also pass a default that covers the entire operation,
    should the lookup fail at any level.

    Args:
       root: The target nesting of dictionaries, lists, or other
          objects supporting ``__getitem__``.
       path (tuple): A sequence of strings and integers to be successively
          looked up within *root*. A dot-separated (``a.b``) string may 
          also be passed.
       default: The value to be returned should any
          ``PathAccessError`` exceptions be raised.

def research(root, query=..., reraise: bool = False, enter=...):
    """
    The :func:`research` function uses :func:`remap` to recurse over
    any data nested in *root*, and find values which match a given
    criterion, specified by the *query* callable.

    Results are returned as a list of ``(path, value)`` pairs. The
    paths are tuples in the same format accepted by
    :func:`get_path`. This can be useful for comparing values nested
    in two or more different structures.

    Here's a simple example that finds all integers:

    >>> root = {'a': {'b': 1, 'c': (2, 'd', 3)}, 'e': None}
    >>> res = research(root, query=lambda p, k, v: isinstance(v, int))
    >>> print(sorted(res))
    [(('a', 'b'), 1), (('a', 'c', 0), 2), (('a', 'c', 2), 3)]

    Note how *query* follows the same, familiar ``path, key, value``
    signature as the ``visit`` and ``enter`` functions on
    :func:`remap`, and returns a :class:`bool`.

    Args:
       root: The target object to search. Supports the same types of
          objects as :func:`remap`, including :class:`list`,
          :class:`tuple`, :class:`dict`, and :class:`set`.
       query (callable): The function called on every object to
          determine whether to include it in the search results. The
          callable must accept three arguments, *path*, *key*, and
          *value*, commonly abbreviated *p*, *k*, and *v*, same as
          *enter* and *visit* from :func:`remap`.
       reraise (bool): Whether to reraise exceptions raised by *query*
          or to simply drop the result that caused the error.


    With :func:`research` it's easy to inspect the details of a data
    structure, like finding values that are at a certain depth (using
    ``len(p)``) and much more. If more advanced functionality is
