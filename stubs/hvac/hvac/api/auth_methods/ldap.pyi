        :type token_bound_cidrs: list
        :param token_explicit_max_ttl: If set, will encode an explicit max TTL onto the token. This is a hard cap even

            tried in-order.
        :type url: str | unicode
        :param case_sensitive_names: If set, user and group names assigned to policies within the backend will be case
            sensitive. Otherwise, names will be normalized to lower case. Case will still be preserved when sending the
            username to the LDAP server at login time; this is only for matching local user/group definitions.
        :type case_sensitive_names: bool
        :param starttls: If true, issues a StartTLS command after establishing an unencrypted connection.
        :type starttls: bool

            constructed UPN will appear as [username]@UPNDomain. Example: example.com, which will cause vault to bind as
            username@example.com.
        :type upndomain: str | unicode
        :param upn_domain: Alias for upndomain. This alias will be removed in v3.0.0.

        :param groupfilter: Go template used when constructing the group membership query. The template can access the
            following context variables: [UserDN, Username]. The default is
            `(|(memberUid={{.Username}})(member={{.UserDN}})(uniqueMember={{.UserDN}}))`, which is compatible with several
            common directory schemas. To support nested group resolution for Active Directory, instead use the following
            query: (&(objectClass=group)(member:1.2.840.113556.1.4.1941:={{.UserDN}})).
        :type groupfilter: str | unicode
        :param group_filter: Alias for groupfilter. This alias will be removed in v3.0.0.
        :type group_filter: str | unicode

            objects, use: memberOf. The default is cn.
        :type groupattr: str | unicode

        :type group_attr: str | unicode

            group membership resolution in large directories.

        :param token_ttl: The incremental lifetime for generated tokens.
        :type token_ttl: str | unicode
