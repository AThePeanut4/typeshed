    Create a soft assertion context.

    Normally, any assertion failure will halt test execution immediately by raising an error.
    Soft assertions are way to collect assertion failures (and failure messages) together, to be
    raised all at once at the end, without halting your test.

    Examples:
        Create a soft assertion context, and some failing tests::

            from assertpy import assert_that, soft_assertions

            with soft_assertions():
                assert_that('foo').is_length(4)
                assert_that('foo').is_empty()
                assert_that('foo').is_false()
                assert_that('foo').is_digit()
                assert_that('123').is_alpha()

        When the context ends, any assertion failures are collected together and a single
        ``AssertionError`` is raised::

            AssertionError: soft assertion failures:
            1. Expected <foo> to be of length <4>, but was <3>.
            2. Expected <foo> to be empty string, but was not.
            3. Expected <False>, but was not.
            4. Expected <foo> to contain only digits, but did not.
            5. Expected <123> to contain only alphabetic chars, but did not.

    Note:
        The soft assertion context only collects *assertion* failures, other errors such as
        ``TypeError`` or ``ValueError`` are always raised immediately.  Triggering an explicit test
        failure with :meth:`fail` will similarly halt execution immediately.  If you need more
        forgiving behavior, use :meth:`soft_fail` to add a failure message without halting test
        execution.

    Set the value to be tested, and optional description and logger, and allow assertions to be
    called, but never fail, only log warnings.

    This is a factory method for the :class:`AssertionBuilder`, but unlike :meth:`assert_that` an
    `AssertionError` is never raised, and execution is never halted.  Instead, any assertion failures
    results in a warning message being logged. Uses the given logger, or defaults to a simple logger
    that prints warnings to ``stdout``.


    Args:
        val: the value to be tested (aka the actual value)
        description (str, optional): the extra error message description. Defaults to ``''``

    Examples:
        Usage::

            from assertpy import assert_warn

            assert_warn('foo').is_length(4)

        Even though all of the above assertions fail, ``AssertionError`` is never raised and
        test execution is never halted.  Instead, the failed assertions merely log the following
        warning messages to ``stdout``::

        Use :meth:`assert_warn` if and only if you have a *really* good reason to log assertion
        failures instead of failing.
