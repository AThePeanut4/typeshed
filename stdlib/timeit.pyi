class Timer:
    """
    Class for timing execution speed of small code snippets.

    The constructor takes a statement to be timed, an additional
    statement used for setup, and a timer function.  Both statements
    default to 'pass'; the timer function is platform-dependent (see
    module doc string).  If 'globals' is specified, the code will be
    executed within that namespace (as opposed to inside timeit's
    namespace).

    To measure the execution time of the first statement, use the
    timeit() method.  The repeat() method is a convenience to call
    timeit() multiple times and return a list of results.

    The statements may contain newlines, as long as they don't contain
    multi-line string literals.

    Main program, used when run as a script.

    defaulting to sys.argv[1:].

    The return value is an exit code to be passed to sys.exit(); it
    may be None to indicate success.

    When an exception happens during timing, a traceback is printed to
    stderr and the return value is 1.  Exceptions at other times
    (including the template compilation) are not caught.

    and returns another timer function (used for unit testing).
