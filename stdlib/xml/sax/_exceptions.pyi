    This exception will include information for locating the error in
    the original XML document. Note that although the application will
    receive a SAXParseException as the argument to the handlers in the
    ErrorHandler interface, the application is not actually required
    to raise the exception; instead, it can simply read the
    information in it and take a different action.

    Since this exception is a subclass of SAXException, it inherits
    the ability to wrap another exception.
